// Folia is MIT, and it is tempting to conclude that a permissively licensed
// product has nothing further to do. That is the wrong reading. Nearly every
// permissive licence in this tree - MIT, ISC, BSD, Apache-2.0 - grants the
// right to redistribute ON CONDITION that its own copyright notice and licence
// text are reproduced in the distribution. The obligation belongs to each
// dependency and is completely independent of the licence Folia chooses for
// itself. `build.files` ships `node_modules/**/*`, so all of them are in the
// installer, and until this file existed none of their notices were.
//
// Three sources have to be merged, because no single one sees everything:
//
//   1. The npm production tree. electron-builder prunes devDependencies but
//      ships the rest, so `npm ls --omit=dev --all` is the shipped set.
//   2. libs/, which is vendored by scripts/vendor-libs.js. Most of it is also
//      an npm dependency and so already covered - but Tabulator is NOT a
//      declared dependency at all. It exists only as a committed file, so a
//      dependency-tree walk cannot see it, and it would have been the one
//      component shipped with no notice and no version record anywhere.
//   3. Things that are not JavaScript packages: the Fira Code fonts (OFL-1.1,
//      which additionally requires the licence to travel beside the font files
//      themselves - see scripts/vendor-libs.js) and Electron/Chromium.
//
// Electron and Chromium are deliberately referenced rather than inlined:
// electron-builder already emits LICENSE.electron.txt and the ~8 MB
// LICENSES.chromium.html next to the executable, so copying them here would
// create a second copy that goes stale on every Electron bump.
//
// Regenerate with `npm run notices`. test-packaging.js regenerates it in
// memory and fails if the committed file differs, so adding a dependency
// without refreshing the notices is caught rather than shipped.

// it would be actively wrong, because it would pick one limb and drop the
// other. Missing the second limb is invisible in the output (the entry looks
// complete: it names the full expression and reproduces a real licence), which
// is why `assertConjunctiveCovered` exists rather than a comment saying "don't
// forget".
//
// Keyed by package name, because the SCOPE of the second licence is a fact
// about the package's own layout, not about the expression. The worked example
// is pako, which used to be here: its README states the split ("MIT - all
// files, except /lib/zlib folder" / "ZLIB - /lib/zlib content"), and
// lib/zlib/README is the package's self-contained statement of those scoped
// terms - it names the folder it covers, names the copyright holders, and
// reproduces the whole Zlib licence. Reproducing that file verbatim keeps such
// a block in the same provenance class as every other licence block in this
// file: copied from the package, not reconstructed.
//
// THE TABLE IS EMPTY, DELIBERATELY, AND THAT IS NOT THE SAME AS UNUSED. pako
// left the tree with html-to-docx's closure when Word export was removed, and
// no dependency here declares a conjunctive licence today. An entry for a
// package that is not installed is data nothing reads and no test can notice
// rotting - the `rel` path cannot even be checked - so it was removed rather
// than kept as decoration. `assertConjunctiveCovered` below is driven by the
// SPDX expression rather than by this table precisely so that the next
// conjunctive dependency to arrive trips it and gets an entry written against
// a real package on disk. Its sensitivity is proven synthetically in
// test-packaging.js, so that coverage does not depend on which packages happen
// to be installed.
//
// COROLLARY, for whoever reads `{}` and reaches for the delete key: the guard
// is NOT dead code that this empty table made redundant. It is the only thing
// enforcing the emptiness. `assertConjunctiveCovered` throws on any AND
// expression it finds on disk whether or not this table has entries, so an
// empty table plus a live guard is a build that fails loudly on the next
// conjunctive dependency; an empty table with the guard removed is one that
