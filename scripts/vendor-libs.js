// vendor-libs.js - copy runtime libraries out of node_modules
// ============================================
//
// index.html used to pull marked, mermaid and DOMPurify from a public CDN at
// runtime. In a window with `nodeIntegration: true` that is a remote code
// execution path: anyone able to tamper with the CDN response (a compromised
// CDN, a hostile network, DNS spoofing) gets `require("child_process")` on the
// user's machine. DOMPurify being one of them is worse still - the sanitiser
// protecting against malicious markdown was itself fetched over the network.
//
// It also meant the app could not render anything offline, and that the
// versions in package.json were decorative: `npm audit` inspected the npm tree
// while the app actually ran whatever the CDN served.
//
// This copies the real installed builds into libs/vendor/ so the app runs the
// audited versions.
//
// IT RUNS ON `postinstall`, BUT THAT IS NOT ENOUGH TO STOP THE COPIES DRIFTING
// FROM package.json, and this comment used to claim it was. MEASURED on npm
// 11.16.0: a bare `npm install` fires the root postinstall, and
// `npm install <pkg>@<ver>` DOES NOT. The drift window is therefore exactly the
// command a dependency bump is made with - a bump leaves node_modules on the
// new version and libs/vendor on the old one, silently, and the app goes on
// running bytes that no longer match anything the lockfile or `npm audit`
// describes. RUN `npm run vendor` AFTER ANY BUMP. test/test-packaging.js
// asserts both halves (bytes against node_modules, and VERSIONS.json against
// the installed versions), so the drift now fails loudly instead of shipping.
