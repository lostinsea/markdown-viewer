    // stage by stage rather than reasoned about, and read out of the vendored
    // dompurify rather than assumed:
    //
    //   trim()-broader direction (\u00A0, \u2003, \uFEFF): marked passes
    //     `<a href="&#160;">` through verbatim; the HTML parser decodes it to
    //     U+00A0 (char codes [160] off a scratch div); and DOMPurify's
    //     `stringTrim(initValue)` (purify.js:1917) empties it, after which the
    //     validity chain's final `else if (value) return false`
    //     (purify.js:1805-1806) KEEPS the now-empty attribute. hrefAttr === "".
    //   URL_BLANK-broader direction (\u0001-\u0008, \u000E-\u001F): these
    //     SURVIVE trim(), so they reach IS_ALLOWED_URI, fail it, and DOMPurify
    //     REMOVES THE ATTRIBUTE ENTIRELY. `link.href` is then "" and the
    //     handler's outer guard declines the anchor before either predicate is
    //     evaluated - a stronger exclusion than the first, not the same one.
    //
    // An earlier draft of this comment credited ATTR_WHITESPACE for all of it.
    // That was wrong twice over: \uFEFF is not even in ATTR_WHITESPACE
    // (purify.js:332), and ATTR_WHITESPACE is only used to normalise the value
    // for the IS_ALLOWED_URI *test*, never to rewrite what is stored. The
    // filter that does the work is native String.trim() - which is to say, the
    // very predicate this revert proposes swapping IN. A \uFEFF carrier was
    // added specifically because it was expected to survive and did not; a
    // \u0001 carrier was added expecting the same emptying and instead revealed
    // the attribute-removal path, which is how the mechanism above got
