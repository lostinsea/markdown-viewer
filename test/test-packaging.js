  // table popup builds its options object as a literal inside a template
  // string, and Tabulator silently ignores options it does not recognise
  // (it only logs, via debugInvalidOptions). A major-version bump can
  // therefore retire an option and leave the app passing it forever: that is
  // not hypothetical, `resizableColumns` is a Tabulator 4.x spelling that was
  // still being passed under 6.2.5, recognised by nothing, and no test could
  // see it because no test ever compared the two sides.
  //
  // THE EARLIER VERSION OF THIS BLOCK CARRIED A COMMENT CLAIMING THAT "the only
  // honest question to ask of a minified bundle is whether the option NAME
  // appears at all". THAT WAS FALSE, and measuring it is what replaced this
  // whole block. Tabulator declares its own option surface in the bundle, in
  // two places, and both can be read exactly:
  //
  //   registerTableOption("name") calls .......... 150 names
  //   the core defaults object literal ............ 43 names
  //   union (measured: zero overlap) .............. 193 names
  //   registerColumnOption + column defaults ...... 136 names
  //
  // THE UNION IS MANDATORY, NOT BELT-AND-BRACES, and that is asserted rather
  // than asserted-about: `data`, `columns` and `height` - three of the twelve
  // options this app actually passes - are reachable ONLY through the defaults
  // literal, and `title`/`field` likewise on the column side. Dropping either
  // half makes a genuinely shipped option look unrecognised.
  //
  // What the loose `\bname\b` matcher it replaces really answered: YES for
  // `fitColumns`, `cellClick` and `rowClick` - none of which are recognised
  // constructor options - because those strings occur in the bundle as values,
  // method names and event names. So it could not fail for any plausible
  // retired option whose name survives anywhere in 3 MB of minified code.
  //
  // THE TEMPLATE-LITERAL RULE, which governs both captures below. `new
  // Tabulator(` lives INSIDE the popup HTML template literal in main.js (the
  // popup script is embedded as string content), so stripping comments from
  // the whole file can never reach it - by design, since the stripper treats a
  // backtick as an ordinary quote and does not descend into an interpolation.
  // Slice from the anchor FIRST (which starts in code context), then strip.
  // And because the hardened stripper is NOT length-preserving (a line comment
  // collapses to "\n", a block comment to one space), an index is only ever
  // valid against the exact string it was computed from.

  // the Electron version claims above, with a worse failure: a reader who is
  // told the document is read-only in view mode, and is wrong, edits a file
  // they believed they were only reading.
  //
  // WHAT THIS PAIR IS, HONESTLY. The behavioural oracle for all three policies
  // already exists and is not here: test-render-patch.js dispatches real
  // contextmenu events in both modes and measures OBSERVED visibility, and
  // drives the real note dialogs with disk bytes as the oracle. This suite is
  // not windowed, so it cannot do that. What it adds is the LINK between the
  // shipped prose and the mechanism named in it - the axis the behavioural
  // suite cannot see, because a test that drives the product is blind to the
  // README drifting away from it.
  //
  // THE MECHANISM HALVES ARE STRUCTURAL, NOT SUBSTRING MATCHES, and that
  // distinction was earned: a reviewer measured the first version and found two
  // of the three could not fail. `/autoSaveViewModeNote\(\)/` matched four
  // lines, of which one was a COMMENT and one the function's own definition, so
  // deleting both call sites - i.e. actually breaking auto-save - left it
  // green. `/function editOnlyAlwaysVisibleItems\(\)/` matched the definition
  // alone, so emptying the returned list left it green. Each mechanism half now
  // parses the function it names and asserts something the disabled version
  // could not satisfy: the gate call must be a live statement inside
  // showContextMenu (not commented out, not a stray reference elsewhere), the
  // gate's item list must actually name the eight controls the README
  // enumerates, and auto-save must have at least two live call sites.
  //
  // A reworded or deleted claim is a FAILURE, not a skip - otherwise rewriting
  // the section silently switches the check off, which is exactly what happened

  // them against anything, so the table was written once and then drifted
  // through every dependency bump - the same disease as the four false
  // keyboard-shortcut rows and the three-of-five download table above.
  //
  // Every row's truth comes from an INDEPENDENT source, never from a second
  // copy of the number maintained beside the assertion:
  //  - npm-sourced components resolve through package-lock.json. The RESOLVED
  //    version is the one that ships; package.json carries CARET RANGES, so
  //    reading it would compare the README against a range rather than against
  //    a version and would go green on a table that names no shipped release.
  //  - Tabulator is HAND-VENDORED. It is absent from package.json entirely, so
  //    it is invisible to `npm audit`, `npm outdated` and Dependabot alike, and
  //    the only statement of its version anywhere in this tree is the banner at
  //    the top of the bundle it ships as.
  //  - Fira Code vendors as five .ttf files that carry no version at all, so a
  //    dash is the honest cell. That is ASSERTED rather than skipped, so the
  //    row cannot quietly acquire an invented number.

    // --- THE VENDORED-INLINING INVARIANT --------------------------------
    // main.js splices two hand-vendored files into the table popup's HTML as
    // element CONTENT: tabulator.min.js inside <script> and tabulator.min.css
    // inside <style>. Those are the only two files inlined that way, so this
    // invariant is deliberately scoped to them rather than stated over libs/.
    //
    // The hazard is the HTML tokenizer, not JavaScript. Inside a <script>, the
    // parser is scanning raw text for the byte sequence "</script" - it does
    // not know or care that the sequence sits inside a JS string literal or a
    // regex. A vendored bundle containing one would terminate the element
    // early, and everything after it would be parsed as MARKUP in a window
    // whose CSP permits inline styles. "<script", "<!--" and "-->" are the
    // same class of hazard via the script-data double-escaped states.
    //
    // A runtime escape was considered and rejected: rewriting "</script" to
    // "<\/script" is safe in a string literal but not inside a regex character
    // class, and the bundle is minified, so a blanket rewrite could silently
    // change its behaviour. These two files are hand-vendored and change only
    // on a deliberate upgrade, so a build-time invariant is the honest control.
