  // parses the function it names and asserts something the disabled version
  // could not satisfy: the gate call must be a live statement inside
  // showContextMenu (not commented out, not a stray reference elsewhere), the
  // gate's item list must actually name the eight controls the README
  // enumerates, and auto-save must have at least two live call sites.
