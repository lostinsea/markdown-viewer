// Regression harness for in-document table display.
// Run with: npm run test:tables
//
// Two defects are guarded here, and the second is the interesting one.
//
// Defect 1 - equal column widths. `.markdown-body table` carried
// `table-layout: fixed`, which splits the available width equally between
// columns and ignores their contents entirely. Measured on a 4-column table
// whose last column held 93.2% of the text, every column got exactly 25.0%:
// the description column had 1.21px per character while its neighbour had
// 71.67px per character, and rows were 236px tall with three nearly empty
// cells beside a wall of wrapped text. Switching to `auto` gave that column
// 84.2% of the width and dropped the tallest row to 95px.
//
// Defect 2 - the one measurements could not see. Under `auto`, the cells'
// `word-break: break-word` offers a break opportunity inside every word, which
// drops a column's min-content width to a single character. The short columns
// duly collapsed and rendered their headers vertically: "Fl/ag", "E/n/v",
// "Own/er". Every width number looked excellent while the table was
// unreadable; it was found by looking at a screenshot. `overflow-wrap:
// break-word` keeps min-content at the longest word, so a header still breaks
// only if the word itself does not fit. Assertion 4 below is that screenshot
// finding turned into something that can never need a screenshot again: a
// header cell must not be taller than a single line of its own text.
//
// Deliberately not asserted: exact pixel widths. They depend on the font, the
// window size and the platform. Every assertion here is a ratio, an ordering
// or a "does not overflow", which is what the design actually promises.

  // resizes the frame, the compositor re-lays-out, and only then does
  // window.innerWidth report the new value. A fixed sleep is a bet on machine
  // load, and it lost - during a 32-revert harness run (32 back-to-back
  // Electron launches) the narrow-window section measured windowWidth=1988
  // after asking for 1000. That surfaced as R72 failing on its VACUITY GUARD
  // instead of its own assertion, i.e. the guard doing exactly its job; had the
  // guard not been there, a measurement taken at the wrong window size would
  // have been recorded as a real result.
  //
  // So: set the bounds, then wait for the RENDERER to agree - poll until
  // innerWidth has actually moved and then held still. A no-op resize is
  // detected up front, because "wait for it to change" would otherwise never
  // be satisfied.
  //
  // Two hardenings after a full-suite run (10 back-to-back Electron launches)
  // left this section measuring 1988 after asking for 1000, failing five
  // assertions that passed when the suite ran alone:
  //   - unmaximize before EVERY resize, not once at the top. Windows silently
  //     ignores setBounds on a maximized window, so a single unmaximize at the
  //     start is not enough if anything re-maximizes later - and an ignored
  //     resize is indistinguishable from a slow one.
  //   - re-issue setBounds while polling instead of asking once and waiting.
  //     A dropped request then costs 500ms rather than the whole section.
  // Neither can turn a real failure green: if the window still never settles
  // the warning is printed and the vacuity guards below fail as before.
  // "Has the resize actually landed?" is decided WITHOUT any chrome constant.
  //
  // This was a hard-coded 40px outer-vs-inner overhead, then a measured-and-
  // cached one. Both were wrong in kind, not just in value: any cached constant
  // can be sampled during the unmaximize transition and poisoned, and both
  // poisoning directions are silent. Measured with a deliberate re-maximize, the
  // first sample read outer=2000 against inner=4288 (delta -2288); the one-shot
  // version cached Math.max(0, -2288) + 8 = 8, which sets the target inner width
  // to 1992 on a window whose real inner width tops out at 1988, so no resize
  // could ever count as arrived. A stability+plausibility guard fixed that case
  // but not the class: a wrong-but-stable delta that still falls inside the
  // plausible range would be cached just as happily.
  //
  // So use the signal Electron already provides exactly. MEASURED on this box:
  //     settled 1200 window : inner 1188, contentBounds 1188, bounds 1200
  //     maximized           : inner 2752, contentBounds 2752, bounds 2766

  // innerWidth reports what the page has actually laid out at, so they are equal
  // exactly when the page has caught up, at any DPR, theme or scrollbar width.
  // getBounds() is the unreliable one - it reported the requested 2000 while the
  // page was still at 1188 - so it is used only to confirm the window accepted

  //   exit:  t+1225ms from renderer.js
  //          t+1364ms from a timer, no caller frames
  // The timer is the 120ms debounce, and the thing that schedules it is the
  // ResizeObserver on .content-wrapper - added later, for the ToC drawer. That
  // attribution is MEASURED, not inferred from "what else could it be": a
  // second probe attached its own ResizeObserver to .content-wrapper and a
  // listener to window resize across the same toggle. The observer fired with
  // contentRect.width changing 1972 <-> 1988, and window resize fired ZERO

  // loses its 16px scrollbar. Note the BORDER-BOX width never moves at all,
  // which is why this had to be measured rather than reasoned about - reading
  // the code, or even getBoundingClientRect(), says nothing changed.
  //

  // the observer is a backstop that arrives ~140ms late, and the explicit call
  // is what stops the user seeing a table at the wrong width for that long -
  // widened tables clipped inside the half-width pane on the way in, and a
  // narrow table in a full-width window on the way out.

  // --- 18. The measurement pass is BATCHED, not interleaved -------------------
  //
  // This is a performance property, and the obvious way to assert it - time the
  // pass - is exactly the way that produces a flaky suite. So assert the
  // STRUCTURE that makes it fast instead, which is deterministic and says what
  // broke when it fails.
  //
  // The defect: `preferredTableWidth()` used to write `width: max-content` onto
  // a table and then immediately read its rect. A write followed by a read
  // forces a synchronous layout, so doing it once per table costs one FULL
  // DOCUMENT layout per table - O(tables x document). Measured on a 1 MB
  // document (2919 tables): 35.5s of a 45.6s render, with the per-table cost
  // rising 3.3 -> 5.7 -> 12.2ms as the document grew, which is the signature of
  // thrash rather than of expensive measurement. Batched, the same pass takes
  // 2.3s.
  //
  // The observable difference: when every table is written FIRST and read
  // afterwards, all N tables are simultaneously at `max-content` at the moment
  // any one of their rects is read. Interleaved, exactly one ever is. So patch
  // getBoundingClientRect, and on each TABLE read count how many tables are
  // currently at max-content. Batched => N. Thrashing => 1.
  //
  // The assertion is on the MINIMUM of those counts, not the maximum, and the
  // difference is the whole strength of the oracle. A maximum is satisfied by
  // the FIRST sample alone, so an implementation that wrote every table up
  // front but then restored each one inside the read loop would produce
  // N, N-1, N-2, ... - a maximum of N, and a green test - while forcing a fresh
  // layout for every table after the first and leaving the pass just as
  // quadratic as before. The minimum can only reach N if no table was released
  // before the last one was read, which is the property being claimed.
  //
  // The only TABLE rects read during this pass are the ones in
  // tablePreferredRead: the container reads are on a DIV and
  // measureTextColumnCap's probe reads a CELL, so the tagName filter isolates
  // the phase exactly. Probe tables are excluded by their absolute positioning
  // anyway, so a future probe that outlived its measurement could not inflate

  // --- 12d. Zoom keeps the reader's place --------------------------------
  // THE DEFECT, measured against a pre-registered formula before anything was
  // written: `.content-wrapper` is the scroller in normal view and `#viewer`
  // carries the CSS `zoom`, so the scroller sits OUTSIDE the scaled subtree.
  // Scaling grows scrollHeight and leaves scrollTop exactly where it was, which
  // throws the reader
  //     scrollTop * (newDocHeight / oldDocHeight - 1)
  // pixels down the document on every zoom step. It is depth-PROPORTIONAL,
  // which is why it survived for years: 154px at the top of a document and
  // 24,747px - about 24 screens - at 90% depth. Three clicks of the zoom button
  // and whatever you were reading is gone.
  //
  // THE ORACLE IS DELIBERATELY NOT THE FIX'S OWN MODEL. The fix remembers a
  // point as (element, fraction of that element's height); an oracle built the
  // same way would be judging a formula with a copy of that formula, which is
  // the defect GPT-5.4 found in test-tab-refresh.js Scenario 4 and it cannot
  // fail. It also would not WORK here: in split view the anchor can be a 91,429
  // px section whose text genuinely RE-WRAPS under zoom (offsetWidth 932 -> 704,
  // 3,845 -> 3,864 line boxes), so its height moves 1.3055x against the text's
  // 1.3000x and the oracle slides relative to the words on the screen. Measured
  // with that oracle the split-view depth-0 cell read -58px for the shipped
  // design and -33px for a cruder one; measured with the leaf-edge oracle below
  // the same two cells read -6px and +33px, i.e. the ORDER INVERTED. The
  // oracle, not the fix, was what moved.
  //
  // So: find the LEAF element nearest the pane centre - no element children,
  // non-empty text - and track its TOP EDGE relative to the pane centre. No
  // fraction, no height model, nothing a re-wrap can distort.
  //
  // The oracle has one inherent error, and it is SUBTRACTED rather than
  // tolerated. The leaf's top sits some distance from the aimed point, and that
  // distance is in DOCUMENT space, so it scales with the zoom even under a
  // perfect fix: exactly offset * (ratio - 1). residualOf() removes that term,
  // so the bars below measure the FIX's error rather than the instrument's.
  //
  // CORRECTION, and both reviewers reached it independently: the subtraction is
  // EXACTLY affine at any distance, not a local linearisation. `offset * (ratio
  // - 1)` is the closed form of how a document-space distance scales, so it is
  // just as exact at 11,741px as at 10px and there is no linearisation error to
  // bound. The earlier claim that it "is only linear while the leaf is near the
  // aimed point" was simply wrong, and it mattered: a future editor believing
  // it would relax the 40px guard from 40 to 200 on entirely false grounds.
  // What that guard really bounds is REFLOW - the further the leaf sits from
  // the aimed point, the more re-wrap can happen between them and change the
  // distance itself, which no closed form can subtract.
  //
  // Every cell is run TWICE. The OFF arm neutralises window.captureZoomAnchor,
  // which really does disable the fix in the real pipeline - renderer.js is a
  // classic script, so its top-level function declarations are writable
  // properties of the global object AND the internal call sites resolve through
  // that binding. With nothing captured applyZoomAnchor() returns immediately,
  // so the OFF arm is exactly HEAD. It is the sensitivity control: without it,
  // an oracle that had quietly stopped measuring anything would report every
  // cell at 0px drift and read as a flawless pass.

  // The two residual bars differ for a MEASURED reason, not a convenient one.

  // genuinely re-wraps - 3,845 -> 3,864 line boxes on the notices document - and
  // exact preservation is impossible in principle there.
  // NORMAL WAS 8 AND THAT WAS AN EMPIRICAL FLOOR, NOT A DERIVED ONE - both
  // reviewers flagged it. It is now 3, reached by two independent routes that
  // agree, which is what makes it a bar rather than a description of the
  // status quo (the licence audit's `> 200` against a real 220 disease):
  //   MEASURED - with the scrollerScale() divisor error fixed, the three normal
  //   cells read -0.2 / 0 / -0.8 px. Worst 0.8, so 3 is 3.75x of headroom.

  //   rounding of the reported drift (0.5), the tare's own rounding (~0.15) and
  //   layout quantisation (~1). That budget is ~2.2, i.e. the same number.
  // At 8 this bar could not see the divisor defect at all: the cells read
  // 2.8 / 4.0 / -2.8 before the fix and every one of them passed. R418 is what
  // keeps that true - it restores the defect, and only a bar near the derived
  // value fails. Split stays 24 because its residual is dominated by genuine

  // subtree stands a pending zoom anchor down. R432 proves the product reports
  // the code-block wrap; it says nothing about the other paths that reparent or
  // remove nodes without going through a render at all. Those were found by
  // review to be HALF-COVERED: renderTableInDOM and renderMermaidInDOM each
  // reported their `replace` branch and stayed silent on their `insert` branch,
  // which appends straight into #viewer and displaces everything below it.
  //
  // A later review round found the COVERAGE half-covered in the mirror image:
  // the four legs below drove insert and delete but never `replace`, so the
  // two branches that had prompted the whole cell were themselves unpinned and
  // could be deleted with every assertion staying green. Both replace branches
  // are now driven (R445/R446), which is what makes this cell exhaustive over
  // the function rather than over the accident that was found first.
  //
  // So this cell calls the REAL product functions - not copies of them - and
  // requires the counter to move across each one. It reads the counter around
  // each call individually rather than once at the end, because a single
  // end-to-end delta would be satisfied by any ONE of the six reporting.
  //
  // Each site gets its own revert for the same reason R431 and R432 are two
  // entries: one revert cannot distinguish which site went silent.
  //
  // The source document is saved and restored, and so is the rendered fixture -
  // both delete functions REWRITE originalMarkdown, and the restore is in a
  // finally because the poll-and-throw lesson from the wrapper cell above

  // ZOOMING OUT AT AND NEAR THE BOTTOM (Opus S3), WHICH NO CELL REACHED.

  // reader and the engine clamps the scroll. Measured first, then written, and
  // the measurement produced two DIFFERENT contracts that had to be separated:
  //
  //   AT THE HARD BOTTOM the anchor is exactly NEUTRAL. Measured on this
  //   fixture, the final scroll is byte-identical with the anchor on and off
  //   (both 57708, the new maximum), and the tracked content shifts by the same
  //   117.2px either way. That drift is not a defect and cannot be fixed: at
  //   the bottom the last line is pinned, so content above it must move toward
  //   it as the document shrinks. Hand-checked - a point 510px above the bottom
  //   at 130% sits (932-422)/1.3 = 392px above it at 100%, i.e. y = 540 against
  //   539.4 measured. Asserting a small drift here would be asserting something
  //   geometrically false; what IS assertable is that the anchor does not push
  //   the scroll away from the clamp.
  //
  //   NEAR THE BOTTOM the anchor is LOAD-BEARING, and this is the case worth
  //   having. At 95% depth the pre-zoom scroll (71432) exceeds the post-zoom
  //   maximum (57708), so with the correction disabled the engine clamps and

  // S8: AN ORDINARY ZOOM STEP CROSSES THE wrap-anyway THRESHOLD, AND WHAT
  // ABSORBS IT IS CHROMIUM'S OWN SCROLL ANCHORING.
  //
  // applyTableBreakout() toggles `wrap-anyway` on `wanted > available`.
  // `available` is measured OUTSIDE the zoom-scaled subtree, so it is invariant
  // under zoom; `wanted` is measured INSIDE it, so it scales linearly with
  // zoom. A single zoom step can therefore cross that threshold with NO resize,
  // NO stale budget and NO DOM mutation at all - which means
  // noteViewerMutation() never fires and the anchor cannot stand itself down.
  // Measured on this fixture: every table flips, and the document grows AFTER
  // the anchor frame has already restored the reading position.
  //
  // The reader nevertheless does not move, and that was established by an A/B
  // rather than inferred. With overflow-anchor at its default the on-screen
  // displacement is 0.11px and scrollTop moves +27; with it set to none the
  // displacement is 26.3px and scrollTop does not move at all. The two shift
  // profiles are mirror images offset by the same 26.4px.
  //
  // THAT IS EXACTLY WHY IT IS PINNED HERE. Nothing in src/ mentions
  // overflow-anchor, so the thing doing the work is an ENGINE DEFAULT that one
  // future declaration - overflow-anchor: none, or a containment /
  // content-visibility experiment on the scroller - could remove silently,
  // handing the reader a 26px jump with nothing failing.
  //
  // WINDOW WIDTH IS PART OF THE FIXTURE, not incidental. The crossing point is
  // available/wanted; at the suite's 2000px window available is 1924 against a
  // wanted of 1120, which no 10% step from 100% can reach. At 1300px available
  // is 1224 and the crossing point is 1224/1120.41 = 1.0925, straddled exactly
  // by the 100 -> 110 step.

  // ─── S9. Ctrl+wheel is anchored too, and that is now the USER'S DECISION ──

  // hold the point under the mouse cursor (what browsers and VS Code do). They
  // chose the reading position for every zoom path. This pins that choice, the
  // same way the `ul` 2em gutter and `breaks: false` are pinned - a deliberate
  // non-change recorded as a contract rather than left as an omission.
  //
  // It holds today for a reason that is easy to lose by accident:
  // captureZoomAnchor() is the FIRST statement of updateZoom() (renderer.js),
  // so every entry point inherits the anchor for free. The realistic accident
  // is a wheel path that stops going through updateZoom() - which is exactly
  // what "zoom toward the cursor" or "make the wheel path cheaper" would do.
  //
  // THE ORACLE IS AN EQUIVALENCE, NOT A RESIDUAL, and that is deliberate. The
  // button path's quality is already pinned by twelve cells against a derived
  // bar; asserting the wheel path lands where the BUTTON path lands from an
  // identical start inherits all of it, and cannot drift away from it later.
  // A residual copy here would be a second bar to keep in step with the first.
  //
  // A SYNTHETIC WheelEvent IS THE RIGHT INSTRUMENT HERE, and the reason is
  // measured rather than assumed. An untrusted event cannot drive Chromium's
  // NATIVE zoom - but a trusted CDP probe showed there is no native zoom to
  // drive (webFrame zoom factor stayed 1.0 across Ctrl+wheel steps, because
  // Electron disables ctrl+wheel page zoom by default), and no native scroll
  // either: the listener is registered { passive: false } (renderer.js, at the
  // end of the wheel handler) so its preventDefault() is honoured. Measured at
  // the zoom limits, where the handler's own guard refuses to act and so
  // nothing can mask a stray scroll, the scroll moved 0px while a plain
  // no-Ctrl wheel in the same probe moved exactly 120px.
  //
  // A CORRECTION KEPT ON THE RECORD, because the wrong version was written
  // down first: this listener was described as "forced passive" on the
  // strength of a console warning that was never traced to it. It is not - the
  // passive-by-default rule applies only where `passive` is unspecified. The
  // 0px reading was right; the reason given for it was wrong, and a measured
  // number attached to a false mechanism is exactly the failure this project
  // keeps rediscovering.

  // FOUND BY REVIEW, CONFIRMED BY MEASUREMENT, and it corrected the reviewers
  // as well as the code. Both independent reviewers flagged that the stale
  // branch of republishBreakoutBudgetForZoom() calls publishBreakoutBudget(),
  // which reads wrapper.clientWidth - and that this ran AFTER updateZoom() had
  // written viewer.style.zoom, making it a forced synchronous relayout of the
  // whole zoomed document inside the click handler. Measured on a
  // 9-table/90-section document: 14.7ms against 0.7ms for the cheap path.
  //
  // One reviewer additionally predicted a CORRECTNESS failure - that Chromium's
  // scroll anchoring would fire during that forced layout, move scrollTop
  // before zoomAnchorSuperseded() sampled it, trip the 2px slack and silently
  // discard the reader's correction. That was REFUTED by measurement: the shift
  // was 0.00px on both paths, with a positive control proving the stale branch
  // really ran (publishBreakoutBudget lowers the flag as a side effect, so a
  // flag still raised would have meant the leg measured nothing).
  //
  // The other reviewer proposed simply moving the zoom write later. That would
  // have been WRONG: publishBreakoutBudget derived the factor from computed
  // style, so it would have published `available / oldZoom`. Passing the factor
  // explicitly is what makes the reorder safe, and the budget assertion below
  // is what pins that - it is the half that has a crisp, timing-free oracle.

  // by ONE LINE BOX in the pixels the drift is measured in. Derived rather than
  // observed: lineH is read off the tracked leaf in the subtree's own px and
  // scaled by the zoom the step ended at.
  //
  // THE MULTIPLY IS THE PART THAT WAS QUESTIONED (Opus S7, "the rewrapBar
  // derivation is overstated") and it is settled by MEASUREMENT, not argument -
  // this project has been wrong about coordinate spaces under CSS `zoom` three
  // times. Probing one leaf at 100/130/200/260%: getComputedStyle().lineHeight
  // reads 23.4 at EVERY level (ratio to base 1.000), while the same leaf's
  // getBoundingClientRect().height reads 46.8 / 60.83 / 93.6 / 121.68 - exactly
  // 1.3x, 2.0x, 2.6x. So the computed length is in the subtree's OWN pre-zoom
  // pixels and the rect is in viewport pixels, which is precisely the conversion
  // this multiply performs. S7 REFUTED on its stated point: the bar does not
  // double-count the zoom.
  // The bar keeps real slack over the measured residual, and that is the
  // INTENDED shape - it is a derivation (one line box), not an empirical floor
  // fitted to the status quo, which is exactly the fault the old 8/24 bars had.
  // The numbers are PRINTED on every run below rather than asserted in prose,
  // where an earlier "~75px" estimate sat unverified for want of anyone reading
  // it back off a run.
  // The split cells keep their measured 24 rather than adopting this rule,
  // because at 130% the same derivation yields ~38 and 24 is the tighter of the
  // two - there is no reason to loosen a bar that passes with margin.

  // producer unproven: if extractTableData() started emitting a differently
  // shaped column - a nested `columns` array, a `titleHtml` key, a title the
  // boundary never sees - the boundary assertions would still pass while a
  // real document reached Tabulator unescaped. This is the only assertion in
  // the project that exercises markdown -> extractTableData -> IPC ->
  // normaliseTablePayload -> Tabulator as one path.
  // THE FIXTURE USES ENTITIES ON PURPOSE, and the first attempt at it is worth
  // recording. Written as literal `<img src=x onerror=...>` markdown, this
  // measured elements:0, imgs:0, pwned:null but paintsRaw:FALSE - and the error
  // sentinel caught two broken images. That is the document path defending
  // itself twice over: DOMPurify keeps <img> but strips onerror, and then
  // extractTableData() reads the header's textContent, which drops the element
  // entirely. So literal markup can never reach a column title from a document,
  // and a fixture written that way proves nothing about the boundary.
  //
  // Entities survive both layers as TEXT, so textContent yields the characters

  // about, now arriving through the real producer instead of a hand-written
