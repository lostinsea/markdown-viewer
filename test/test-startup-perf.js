// Regression harness for PERF-01: heavy optional modules must not be required
// during startup.
//
// docs/PERF-AUDIT.md measured require("html-to-docx") at 370.1ms and
// require("electron-updater") at 174.7ms — 544.8ms of main-thread work before
// the window could even be created, paid by every launch regardless of whether
// the session ever exported a DOCX or checked for an update. html-to-docx has
// since been removed outright along with Word export, which retires the larger
// of the two costs by deletion rather than by deferral; electron-updater is now
// the only production dependency, and the lazy-load property still has to hold
// for it.
//
// This harness IS the Electron main script. It requires ./main.js, so main.js
// runs in this very process and shares this process's module registry. That
// makes require.cache a direct, non-vacuous observation of what startup loaded
// — not a grep over source text, which would pass the moment someone moved the
// require behind an alias.
//
// The module must remain genuinely loadable, otherwise "not in the cache" would
// be trivially satisfiable by deleting the dependency — which is exactly what
// happened to html-to-docx, and is why that pair of assertions was removed
// together rather than leaving a load check standing over a deleted package.
// Section 2 loads it explicitly and checks the shape the call sites depend on.

// Isolation must be established before ../src/main.js is required and before the
// app becomes ready: main.js registers the ipcMain "confirm-large-render"
// handler and creates a real window, so running against the developer's real
// profile let a restored session containing a large document open a
// main-process modal that no test can dismiss.
//
// RETRACTED: this comment used to say "this suite is the ONLY one that requires
// ../src/main.js". That is false and was false when written - MEASURED, nine
// suites require it (mermaid, popups, security, patch, search, startup, tabs,
// tables, theme), which is exactly why one poisoned shared profile blocked the
// whole chain rather than one suite. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` already
// carries the correction; the claim is retracted here too because it is the
// stated rationale for the isolation assertions below.
