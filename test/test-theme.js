//
// That is a user requirement, not a nicety - "make sure current themes also
// bundle up as Dark/Light defaults" - so the oracle is a FROZEN BASELINE
// captured from the tree at commit 4bbde83, before any of the refactor landed.
// test/fixtures/theme-golden.json is committed literal data produced by
// scripts/capture-theme-golden.js, by hand, deliberately. It is NEVER
// regenerated from a test run: if it were, changing a colour would rewrite the
// file this suite reads, the assertion could not fail, and the revert proof
// would come back VACUOUS.
//
// It records the FULL VISUAL TUPLE rather than colour alone. That is a measured
// requirement: `entity` is separated from `operator` only by its background and
// cursor, and `namespace` from `tag` only by opacity, so a colour-only baseline
// lets both regress green. It also records the code box (padding, radius,
// tab-size, white-space...) because every one of those used to come from the
// vendored light Solarized stylesheet and DARK MODE DEPENDED ON IT - dropping
// that <link> without porting them would have degraded both themes silently.
//
// THE AMENDMENTS TABLE IS THE OTHER HALF OF THE DESIGN. Three dark-mode cells
// are deliberately NOT reproduced, because the old dark block overrode `color`
// only and the light stylesheet leaked everything else into dark mode. Each is
// listed below with a reason and its new expected value. The golden itself is
// never edited, so it stays a faithful record of what shipped - and a FOURTH
// deviation, which nobody decided on, fails loudly instead of hiding among
// three that were.

   R300 stretches a themed transition past the settle budget, and since
   applySettled() then burns its full 60x50ms poll (plus one exec round-trip
   per poll) on every one of ~30 states, the run lands at roughly 183s. The

   settle assertion at the end of the suite was ever reported - so R300 came
   back WRONG-GUARD and the settle assertion silently had no proof at all.
   That is the worst failure mode available here: a truncated run still prints
   a count and still looks like a result.

//
// Two facts fall out of it, and BOTH are asserted below rather than trusted:
//   1. the used width is ALWAYS a whole number of device pixels
//      (used_css x dpr is an integer in every cell above), so rounding to
//      device pixels is LOSSLESS on this quantity, not lossy;
//   2. the count is `max(1, floor(declared x dpr))` - so ONE declaration does
//      NOT keep a constant device-pixel count across displays. `border: 1px`
//      is 1 device px below DPR 2 and 2 device px at DPR 2. Comparing raw
//      device-pixel counts would therefore have re-broken these same four
//      assertions on any 200%-scaled display (a 4K laptop's default), which is
//      simply the first bug wearing the opposite sign.
//
// So the comparison is made on the only quantity that IS display-independent:
// the set of DECLARED widths that could have produced the observation. From a
// used count of n device pixels at some DPR, the declaration lay in
// [n/dpr, (n+1)/dpr) - or in (0, 2/dpr) when n is 1, because the `max(1, ...)`
// floor means any positive declaration below one device pixel is drawn as one.
// Two observations agree iff those bands INTERSECT. That is exactly as
// sensitive as the available information allows: it accepts every declaration
// consistent with both readings and rejects every one that is not, at any DPR.
// NOTE ON THE DIRECTION, because the two laws are easy to conflate and a
// reviewer did: `max(1, floor(declared x dpr))` above is the FORWARD law, from
// an author's declaration to the pixels Chromium paints. deviceWidth() runs the
// INVERSE - its input is a CSSOM computed value, which is already the snapped
// used width - so it must ROUND, not floor. At DPR 1.5 the used value reads
// back as "0.666667px" and 0.666667 x 1.5 = 0.9999995: floor would report 0
// device pixels for a border that is plainly drawn, and declaredBand would then
// return the zero band and call it a mismatch. Rounding is not a loosening

// pixel and no observation can separate them. The old string comparison did
// catch that, but only at exactly the golden's capture DPR and only by
// accident: it equally reported a false failure whenever the display scaling
// changed, which is the defect this replaced. Sub-device-pixel border

         argument is not a measurement: moving --code-selection-fg to #e8e8e8
         moved no assertion in the suite.
         It is deliberately NOT amended in either default. The F1 fix changed
         WHERE the ink comes from (a named --code-selection-fg instead of the
         app-wide --on-accent-fg) without changing WHAT it is, so both modes
         must still reproduce the golden exactly, and this is the assertion

         answered by the check above: the `*Fg` entries were captured AFTER the
         ink moved to --code-selection-fg, so they are a RE-BASELINE and cannot
         by themselves prove the pre-change value. Every other amendment in
         this suite carries a `was` (see DARK_CODE_SELECTION); the ink has
         none, and none can now be captured.

         AN EARLIER REVISION OF THIS COMMENT RESCUED THAT WITH A CLAIM THIS
         CHANGE FALSIFIES. It said `bodyFg` is painted by the app-wide
         ::selection rule "which this change never touched". A later review
         round measured the rule and it is touched:
           4bbde83:  ::selection { background: var(--primary-color); color: #ffffff; }
           now:      ::selection { background: var(--primary-color); color: var(--on-accent-fg); }
         So the equality below can be satisfied by BOTH halves moving together,
         and on its own it no longer states the byte-exactness claim.

         What actually preserves the ink is measured and pinned immediately
         after: --on-accent-fg is #ffffff at :root and is NOT redeclared on
         body.dark-mode, so both frozen defaults resolve the same white the
         baseline baked. Only the four scheme blocks move it. The equality
         below is still worth asserting - it catches a consuming rule that
         stops consuming - but it is the anchor assertion that carries the
         fidelity half. It is asserted on the two FROZEN DEFAULTS only: a
         curated scheme is entitled to a different selection ink for its code,
         and three of the four use one. */

    /* THE SUBSTITUTION-SCOPE GUARD, WIDENED PAST --tok-*. The two assertions

       four theme variables whose values contain var() were never scope-checked
       at all - --code-inline-bg, --code-inline-fg, --drop-overlay-fg and
       --welcome-readme-ink-hover. Move any one of them to :root and the
       defaults still look right (nothing overrides them today), a scheme can
       still override the variable DIRECTLY, and every existing assertion stays
       green - while a scheme that overrides only the ROLE it derives from
       silently stops reaching it. --welcome-readme-ink-hover is not a
       hypothetical example: a revert in this suite exists because exactly that
       move repainted the dark welcome screen.

       This one is family-agnostic on purpose. It asks the only question the
       Chromium rule actually cares about - does this declaration contain
       var(), and is it declared somewhere <body> can be reached from - so a

       paragraph beginning "POSITION IS LOAD-BEARING": `body[data-theme="x"]`
       and `body.dark-mode` are both specificity (0,1,1) and declare on the
       same element, so SOURCE ORDER alone decides which wins. (Cited by
       heading rather than by line, per the convention custom-styles.css
       states: a change that adds rules above it silently invalidates a line
       number, and this citation had already rotted from 473 to 477.) Move the
       scheme blocks above the dark block and abyss and ember silently lose
       every cell the dark default also declares.
       Review found the defect IS caught today - 10c fails, because the dark
       default's accent reappears everywhere - but by an assertion named for
       STRANDED ACCENTS, which is the wrong-name failure mode this project
       rewrote R366's expect to avoid. Worse, the guard is asymmetric: clarity
       and parchment sit under `body` with no dark block to lose to, so a
       light-only reorder changes nothing and is not caught at all. This reads
       the rule indices directly, so it fails for the reason it is named for
       and covers all four schemes equally.

       IT MUST BE THE **LAST** DARK BLOCK, NOT THE FIRST, AND THAT IS A FACT
       ABOUT THIS STYLESHEET RATHER THAN A HYPOTHETICAL. `findIndex` was the
       first form, and styles.css declares TWO top-level `body.dark-mode`
       rules: the chrome variables, and - three hundred lines later - the
       whole Tomorrow Night syntax palette. A scheme block pasted between them
       therefore sits AFTER the first dark block and loses every --syn- and
       --tok- variable it declares, in dark mode only, with nothing failing.
       Taking
       the last index closes that and additionally covers the appended-block
       accident (a second dark block added at the END of the file would beat
       all four schemes). The full index list is printed so a third dark block
       appearing is visible rather than silently absorbed. R394 is the proof;
       under the old form it passes. */

    /* 10b, SECOND HALF: a cell must RESOLVE, not merely be DECLARED.
       The completeness check above reads the CSSOM, so it answers "does this
       scheme have a declaration for --header-bg" - and `--header-bg:
       var(--typo)` answers YES. A custom property whose value references a
       variable that does not exist computes to the guaranteed-invalid value
       and reads back as the EMPTY STRING, so every consumer of it falls back
       to its own default or paints nothing, while 10b reports full coverage.
       Nothing else in the suite sees it either: 10c only hunts for the DEFAULT
       accent (an unresolved cell paints neither the default nor the scheme
       colour), and 10d skips fully transparent surfaces.

       AN EMPTY COMPUTED VALUE IS NOT ALWAYS A DEFECT, and the distinction is
       measured rather than excused. Light authors four cells as the CSS-wide
       keyword `inherit` - --tok-block-comment, --tok-operator, --tok-namespace
       and --tok-function-name - because Solarized Light declares no rule for
       any of them and the token really must take its parent's colour. That
       computes to the empty string BY DESIGN, and the consumer's
       `color: var(--tok-operator)` becoming invalid-at-computed-value-time is
       precisely the mechanism that produces the inheritance. Those four are
       covered on the appearance axis by the frozen golden, which recorded the
       real painted colour per context chain (operator@class-name yellow vs
       operator@ base00 - the very difference an invented absolute erased).
       So the classifier is the authored value, not a name list: a CSS-wide
       keyword is intended, anything else computing to empty is a broken
       reference. A name list would rot the moment a cell was retuned; this
       cannot, because it reads what the stylesheet actually says.

       THE AUTHORED VALUE MUST BE READ FROM THE STATE THAT IS APPLIED, and
       R304 is the proof - it came back VACUOUS on its first run because the
       classifier read the BASE declaration. Every one of these four cells is
       `inherit` in the light base, so a scheme overriding one with a broken
       var() was classified "by design" using a declaration the scheme had
       already replaced. The probe therefore resolves the WINNING declaration
       on <body> in the live state (last matching rule in document order - the
       three tiers here are body, body.dark-mode and body[data-theme], which
       ascend in both source order and specificity), falling back to :root for
       cells only declared there. Same disease as the mode-inherited probe in
       part 1: an assertion whose subject can be supplied by more than one
       source reports the disjunction unless it is told which one to ask. */

       changes the frozen dark default; --accent-glow-rgb is deliberately
       absent from the dark block for that reason, and R301 is that edit.

       Both halves are asserted separately, because a value that resolves

                               app accent - see the note at styles.css:1659)

       THE HEX NEEDLE IS HERE BECAUSE AN EARLIER VERSION OF THIS COMMENT WAS
       WRONG, AND WRONG IN THE WAY THAT MATTERS. It recorded, as a measured
       fact, that Chromium canonicalises colour values entering the CSSOM - so
       `color: #279ea7` reads back as `rgb(39, 158, 167)` - and concluded that
       a hex needle could never match. The measurement was real but the
       conclusion did not hold, because CANONICALISATION DOES NOT HAPPEN TO A
       VALUE CONTAINING `var()`: such a value is stored as an unparsed token
       sequence. Measured, on this document:
         color: var(--nope, #279ea7)   -> reads back "var(--nope, #279ea7)"
         color: #279EA7                -> reads back "rgb(39, 158, 167)"
       So the ONE spelling that survives into the CSSOM unchanged is a hex
       inside a var() fallback - and `var(--primary-color, #279EA7)` is exactly
       the shape this codebase already writes (custom-styles.css:456 ships
       `var(--primary-color, #2d9cdb)`). It re-freezes the default accent under
       every scheme, and the old needle set could not see it. Hex is matched
       case-insensitively: the product spells it #279EA7, this list spells it
       lower. */

       A LITERAL FALLBACK IS A DEFECT IN EITHER OF THE ONLY TWO STATES IT CAN
       BE IN, which is what makes this a rule rather than a preference:
         - the variable is always declared, so the fallback is unreachable -
           dead paint that reads as a deliberate choice, and that a future
           editor will change expecting an effect; or
         - the variable is sometimes undeclared, so the fallback really does
           paint - a colour belonging to NO scheme, on a surface every scheme
           believes it controls, which is exactly the stranded-accent defect
           10c exists to catch, wearing a spelling 10c cannot see.
       Measured before this was written: the product carried two, both in the
       theme-menu chrome added by this item (--primary-color -> #2d9cdb, the
       pre-Folia accent, and --text-secondary -> #777), and both were in the
       FIRST state - --primary-color resolved to #3DBDC6 on a probe element in
       the live document, so neither fallback could ever have painted.
       Deliberately NOT limited to the frozen accent family: the whole point is
       that these colours belong to no palette, so there is no family to
       enumerate. */
    /* THE CLASSIFIER IS THE ENGINE, NOT A SPELLING LIST. The first version
       tested the fallback against a regex naming five syntaxes (#hex, rgb,
       hsl, color()), which is a list of the colour notations I happened to
       think of - it says nothing about `red`, `oklch()`, `lab()`, or whatever
       CSS Color 6 adds next, and each omission is a silent hole rather than a
       failure. CSS.supports('color', v) asks the shipped Chromium the exact
       question the assertion is named for. The only judgement left is the
       small set of values that ARE valid colours but name no palette entry -
       currentColor, transparent and the CSS-wide keywords - which are
       legitimate fallbacks and are excluded explicitly.

       THE var() PARSER IS PAREN-AWARE, AND THAT IS A FIX RATHER THAN A
       REFINEMENT. The regex it replaces could not see a nested fallback:
       `var(--a, var(--b, #fff))` handed it ` var(--b, #fff)`, which does not
       start with a colour, and its lastIndex then skipped past the inner
       expression entirely - so a literal one level down was invisible. Worse,
       the negative control in the positive-control set (`a var() chain must
       NOT be caught`) certified exactly that escape as correct behaviour. The
       parser now recurses into every fallback, and `-nested-hex` is in the

       no fallback becomes INVALID AT COMPUTED-VALUE TIME if the token is
       missing - for `color` that means it INHERITS, so a scheme block that
       forgot the token would silently paint the menu caption in the row's own
       ink. That is exactly the "reads as a row" defect R343 exists to prevent,
       arriving by a path R343 cannot see, because R343 watches the rule and
       this failure is in the token.
       READ IN ALL SIX STATES, because the risk is per-scheme: the defaults can
       carry every token while a curated block omits one.

       AN EXACT SET, NOT A FILTERED ONE, and that correction came from running
       it. The first form excluded a recorded list and asserted the remainder
       empty, on the premise that an unresolved token is always a mistake. It
       is not: `--tok-block-comment: inherit` is how this stylesheet SAYS
       "Solarized Light writes no rule for block comments", and a custom
       property declared `inherit` on body inherits from html, which has none,
       so it computes to the guaranteed-invalid value and reads back EMPTY -
       indistinguishable from a token nobody declared. Four light-default cells
       are deliberately in that state and reproducing it is the whole point of
       the frozen default.
       So the claim is equality in BOTH directions against a per-state table.
       A scheme that forgets a token appears as an EXTRA and fails; a cell that
       stops being deliberately-inherited appears as a MISSING and fails, which
       makes the table self-expiring in the same way the drift excusals are -
       an entry cannot outlive its reason. A filter could only ever have caught

           lands on, so it owns that ink - inherited colour was chosen against
           the neutral surface and has no relationship to the new one.
           Measuring the ratio catches this only in the states where the two
           happen to differ; naming the missing declaration catches it
           everywhere.
           THE REST->STATE SHAPE IS THE WHOLE POINT, and it is why this is not
           simply "the fill is an accent". Measured across all six states, six
           rules repaint with an accent variable and declare no ink -
           .editor-save-btn, .editor-exit-btn, .welcome-open-btn,
           .file-update-btn.reload, .app-update-btn.primary and
           .note-dialog-btn.primary - and every one of them is ALREADY a
           saturated button at rest (chroma 128-171), merely shifting to its
           hover shade. Their ink was chosen against the accent and is still
           correct over it, so demanding a redeclaration would be six false
           positives. Only a neutral resting surface orphans the ink.
           GATED ON THE ELEMENT ACTUALLY HAVING INK, and that is deliberately
           structural rather than an excusal list: .editor-splitter is exactly
           the neutral->saturated shape (chroma 0 -> 137) and carries neither
           text nor icon, so demanding a colour from it would be demanding a
           declaration with nothing to declare it for. Deriving the exemption

         below could never have found by running.
         (1) DIFFERENT DOMAINS, IDENTICAL CONSUMER. A selector with no hosts
         hit \`continue\`, so it could never be a candidate for \`unexercised\`

         unexercised in BOTH modes. Every \`body.dark-mode ...\` state rule is
         barren by construction in light, so it could be dead in dark and still
         produce an empty intersection. The one assertion R372 is pointed at
         was structurally incapable of firing for exactly the rule family whose
         asymmetry its own comment spends a paragraph explaining.
         (2) DIFFERENT KEYS. \`barren\` was keyed by the flip selector and
         \`unexercised\` by the sentinel, so the two lists could not even be
         cross-referenced after the fact to recover the answer.
         (3) NO ERROR CHANNEL. Both \`catch\` arms fed the healthy path.
         A record carries the three facts separately - did it have hosts, did
         the rule match, did the query throw - so the consumer can apply the

             uncapped the sweep compared 602 cells instead of 376 with no
             increase in suite runtime, and 632 once the scaffold below reached
             the surfaces this document never builds. Coverage is bounded by
             the floors on \`compared\`, which are tied to that measurement. */

               This was \`querySelectorAll(measSel)\` - the BARE selector, matched
               document-wide - narrowed with
               \`.filter((s) => s === host || host.contains(s))\`.
               Two things were wrong with that, and the first is a live hole:

               A SIBLING RULE CONTRIBUTED NOTHING AND EVERY GUARD STAYED GREEN.
               The splitter above deliberately handles \`+\` and \`~\`
               (\`tail.match(/[\\s>+~]/)\`), so \`.a:hover + .b\` yields
               flip \`.a\`, meas \`.a + .b\`. The element \`.a + .b\` finds is a
               SIBLING of the host, so \`host.contains(s)\` is false and it was
               filtered away: zero cells, no \`elements++\`, while \`barren\`
               saw hosts, the match check saw the sentinel match, and the cell
               floor could not notice because the loss was already baked into
               the number the floor was tied to.

               AND A SELF RULE OVER-COUNTED. For \`.a:hover\`, meas is \`.a\`,
               and the filter admitted any NESTED \`.a\` inside the host - an
               element the state was never applied to, measured as though it
               had been.

               The sentinel is the state rule's own selector with the flip
               class already in it, and exactly ONE host carries that class at
               a time. So it selects precisely the elements this rule paints
               for THIS host: siblings included, nested look-alikes excluded,
               no filter required. It is not a wider net - it is the exact one.
               The bare-selector path is kept only for a plan entry with no
               third part, which the collector does not currently emit. */

               is blind to the answer: the cells are read off whatever the
               measure selector finds, so a flip that lands on the wrong element
               yields exactly the same cell set, with the state simply never
               applied. That is not hypothetical - it is what the flip did for
               seven ancestor-state rules, silently, while the totals rose.
               ONCE ACROSS HOSTS, NOT PER HOST, and that is a correction rather
               than a softening: a descendant rule cannot match for a host that
               has no such descendant, and the product has plenty - not every
               context menu item carries an icon. Requiring it per host reported
               a rule as dead when it was merely inapplicable to one of thirty.
               It is now READ OFF THE SAME QUERY THAT PRODUCES THE CELLS rather
               than off a second, independent \`querySelector(sentSel)\` call.
               That retires the last fail-open arm in this loop - the old one
               was \`catch (e) { everMatched = true; }\`, which recorded an
               unparseable sentinel as exercised - and it removes the state
               where a selector could report "matched" while contributing zero

       suite's document never builds - no tab bar, no note, no mermaid diagram,
       no copied/disabled variant - so a hover-colour regression on any of them
       was invisible to the frozen-default sweep. They are scaffolded rather
       than driven: this sweep swaps STYLESHEETS and compares the two results,
       so its subject only has to be an element carrying the right classes in
       the right ancestry. Both halves of the swap see the identical scaffold
       (the DOM is JS-built and is NOT swapped), so a scaffold whose markup is
       wrong yields the same cells twice and reports no drift - it can under-
       report, never false-report. Same precedent as section 9, which injects
       elements carrying Prism classes no bundled grammar emits.
       The ancestry is not guessed: `.mermaid-maximize-btn` and `.img-zoom-btn`
       are nested because their rules put the state on the CONTAINER, and every
       other flip target is a bare compound. Each carries text or an icon,
       because the probe records only nodes that paint ink.
       THE ATTACHMENT CHECK IS A MANIFEST, NOT A COUNT. It was `scaffolded >=
       17` against a real 20 - a magic floor of exactly the shape this section
       removes elsewhere, with three of twenty in slack, so the note-tooltip
       pair and the note label could all have been deleted while the assertion
       named for attaching them went on passing. A bare count is also blind to
       the thing that actually matters here: a review round pointed out that a
       scaffold can keep its element count while losing the ANCESTRY a rule
       depends on, in which case the sweep proves the scaffold rather than the
       product. Each required node is now asserted through the descendant path

    /* ── 10l: SELECTED CODE - the surface the product paints, not the one the
       stylesheet appears to describe ────────────────────────────────────────
       --code-selection-bg was the last colour in this item chosen rather than
       measured, and it is the only themed surface that is TRANSLUCENT on
       purpose, which is why no other section reaches it:
         - 10d skips fully transparent surfaces and reads RESTING backgrounds,
           and a ::selection background is neither;
         - 10g replays a rule's declarations onto a real element, and a
           pseudo-element cannot be selected, so it is skipped by construction;
         - the golden records painted colours, and nothing is selected while it
           is captured.

       THE FIRST VERSION OF THIS SECTION SCORED THE WRONG INK, and it is worth
       recording exactly how, because the mistake was invisible from the CSS.
       It composited the selection tint over the code background and scored the
       TOKEN colours against the result - which is what the stylesheet looks
       like it does, since the code ::selection rule overrides `background`.
       But the app-wide `::selection` rule further down also declares `color`,
       and nothing was overriding THAT, so selecting code replaced the entire
       syntax palette with one flat ink. Captured pixels settled it: an
       unselected block paints 1264 distinct colours and a selected one paints
       128. The section reported 3.5-4.4:1 for the four schemes while the
       reader was actually looking at 1.36, 1.55, 2.18 and 2.15. (Those last
       two were first written down as 1.48 and 1.59, which were honest readings
       taken before abyss's and ember's highlight alphas were raised to their
       shipped 35% and 32%. The two light schemes' pastels are opaque, so their
       figures could not go stale the same way - which is exactly how the
       staleness was spotted.)

       SO THE REGIME IS MEASURED FIRST, AND ASSERTED. Two are possible:
         FLAT    - a ::selection colour is declared, every token is painted in
                   it, and the thing to score is that ONE ink. It is body text
                   on a background, so the bar is 4.5:1.
         THROUGH - no ::selection colour is declared, the token colours survive
                   (Chromium does this for `color: currentColor`, measured),
                   and the thing to score is EVERY token. A syntax palette
                   cannot realistically hold 4.5:1 against a tinted background,
                   so the bar is 3:1, WCAG 1.4.11.
       Which regime the product is in is detected by reading the ::selection
       colour of tokens that have DIFFERENT resting colours: one distinct value
       across many distinct inks is flat by definition. It is asserted as well
       as detected, so flipping the regime is a decision someone has to make
       out loud rather than a side effect.

       THE VISIBILITY FLOOR IS THE OTHER HALF, and without it the section is
       trivially satisfiable: a nearly transparent selection scores perfectly
       on legibility while ceasing to be a selection at all. Both are asserted,
       and the floors are RECORDED MEASUREMENTS per state rather than one
       chosen number, because the light schemes highlight with opaque pastels
       (~1.27) and the dark ones with translucent accent tints (~1.95); a
       single shared bar would have to sit under the lower pair and would then
       be unable to see a regression in the higher four. The shared 1.2 is kept
       underneath as an absolute backstop for a scheme added later.

       THE SUBJECT IS EVERY RENDERED CODE BLOCK, not the first one. The fixture
       renders 13, and an earlier draft read only `querySelector` - the
       JavaScript block - so the worst ink in the HTML block was outside the
       claim while the assertion said "every token". */

       free, so the subject is pinned before anything is scored.

       THE FLOORS ARE MEASURED, NOT CHOSEN. They used to be a bare `8` on both
       counts, which is the magic-number disease this file has already cured
       twice (the `entries.length > 200` licence guard against a real 220, and
       `SELECTION_VISIBLE_FLOOR["light default"]` sitting at a placeholder 1.0).
       A floor nothing can fail is not an assertion: the real subject is
       13 blocks / 8-9 resting inks / 55 cells in every one of the six states,
       so `>= 8` cells had 47 cells of slack and would have waved through a
       sweep that lost 85% of its coverage. The `note:` line below now prints
       all three counts per state on every run, so the floor can never again
       pass silently at a number nobody has read.

       WHY 55 IS THE SAME IN ALL SIX STATES, and why `>= 55` is therefore safe
       rather than brittle: a cell's key is `classSet|selectedInk|backdrop|
       opacity`, and every state here is FLAT (one selected ink across the whole
       block - see the regime note below), so the selected-ink component is
       constant and the partition is decided by the FIXTURE, not the palette.
       A future scheme that selected THROUGH (preserving token colours) would
       only ever ADD cells, so the floor cannot false-fail on one.

       THE OPACITY PARTITION CLAUSE THAT USED TO LIVE HERE WAS A TAUTOLOGY:
       it added the `>= 0.999` and `< 0.999` buckets and compared the sum to
       cells.length. Those two predicates are exact complements over every real
       number, and `opacityOf` seeds `o = 1` and multiplies only when
       `!isNaN(v)`, so `opacity` can never be NaN - the one value that could
       have made it fire. It asserted a hazard the code had already made
       impossible. What actually needs guarding is that BOTH buckets are
       non-empty where they should be, and the assertions below do that. */

         list also names `code[class*="language-"]`, which matches INLINE
         highlighted code. That surface was in the rule's scope and outside
         every measurement of it.

         I EXPECTED THIS TO BE A DEFECT AND THE MEASUREMENT SAID OTHERWISE,
         which is the only reason the premise is now asserted rather than
         assumed. The suspicion was that inline code sits on --code-inline-bg,
         a different variable from the --code-bg the theme-7-contrast alphas
         were swept against, so the derived tints might not clear there. They
         do, because the backdrop is not what I read: the ported Prism rule
         `:not(pre) > code[class*="language-"] { background-color:
         var(--code-bg) }` wins over `.markdown-body code`, so inline
         HIGHLIGHTED code is painted on the very same --code-bg as a block.
         Measured on abyss, whose two variables differ: the painted backdrop is
         rgb(26,32,41) = --code-bg, not its --code-inline-bg #1e2531.
         --code-inline-bg paints only UNHIGHLIGHTED inline code, which carries
         no language- class and is therefore not matched by the code
         ::selection rule at all - it takes the app-wide accent selection, and
         is out of this section's scope by construction rather than by
         omission.
         That identity is asserted below, because it is the entire reason one
         swept alpha covers both surfaces. If it ever stops holding, the two
         bars here go on passing against a backdrop nobody derived them for.

         THE INK IS SINGLE BY CONSTRUCTION, and that is a fact about the
         PRODUCT rather than about the fixture: renderer.js highlightNewElements
         selects `pre code:not(.prism-highlighted)`, so Prism never runs on
         inline code and it carries no tokens at all. The loop below is written
         over whatever cells the probe finds anyway, so if that selector is ever
         widened the new token inks are scored without this assertion changing. */

    // ── 10i: THE PRINTED PAGE, AND THE TWO SCOPE BOUNDARIES ─────────────────
    /* Everything above measures the page on SCREEN. printToPDF renders it
       under `@media print`, which is a different cascade, and this is the only
       section that looks at it.

       IT ALSO CORRECTS AN ASSUMPTION THIS FILE USED TO CARRY. A first probe
       measured `body` and `#viewer` under print emulation, found all six theme
       states resolving to rgb(51,51,51) on white, and concluded the print
       stylesheet neutralises schemes on its own. It does not. Measuring the
       rest of the page shows the neutralisation is scoped:

         - unconditional: body, #viewer                (styles.css:2172,
                                                        custom-styles.css:341)
         - only when body.dark-mode is present: headings, p, li, td, th,
           blockquote, code, pre, table borders, links  (custom-styles.css:355-412)
         - never, in any mode: every .token.* syntax colour

       So on paper, a LIGHT scheme keeps its own code box and its own tokens,
       and a DARK scheme gets a forced-light code box (#f5f5f5) still painted
       with tokens chosen for a near-black one - measured at 2.05:1 (abyss
       keyword), 2.14 (default dark) and 2.38 (ember).

       None of that is reachable through the product, and the reason is the
       whole point of this section: `prepare-for-pdf-export` strips the scheme
       AND the dark class BEFORE main calls printToPDF (renderer.js:2445-2455,
       main.js:1075-1079), and printToPDF on the main window is the only path
       that ever renders this document to paper - there is no
       webContents.print() and no print accelerator anywhere in src/.

       THE GUARANTOR IS THEREFORE THE JS PARK, NOT THE STYLESHEET, and that is
       what the assertions below say. 10e already covers the park's own
       semantics from the registry side; this covers what the reader actually
       gets on paper, by driving the REAL handler over its REAL ready signal.

       Observation recorded rather than asserted: the handler reports ready
       after a double rAF, while the colour transitions a mode change starts
       run for 0.2-0.3s, so printToPDF can in principle capture a page still
       in flight. Asserting on that would be a timing bet; the settle below is
       this instrument being honest about what it measures, not a claim that
       the product waits. */

         checkVisibility() is the filter because @media print hides the
         chrome - the header and its buttons, the search, notes, index and
         editor panels, and (since this work) the three in-content overlay

         assertion is named for what printToPDF captures, which is the same
         subject/measurement mismatch this suite calls a disjunction elsewhere.
         .code-copy-btn rests at opacity 0 and fades in, so the opacity filter
         below excludes it at rest and at full fade - but catches it MID-fade,
         where opacity is fractional and checkVisibility() says "visible". That
         reported "still animating a printed surface: background-color on
         button.code-copy-btn" in 5 of 6 states on one run in four, while
         @media print hides the button outright and it can never reach the PDF.
         So the print-hidden set is derived from the print stylesheet's own
         display:none rules rather than assumed, and an animation whose target
         matches one of them is excluded regardless of what the screen is
         doing. Deriving it means a chrome element that STOPS being hidden in

           the loop - is what a reader's PDF actually contains.
           The handler reports ready after a double rAF (~18ms) while themed
           transitions run 0.2-0.3s, so a review round rated this a probable
           mid-transition capture. MEASURED, it is not one, for two independent
           reasons: document content carries no colour transitions at all
           (custom-styles.css replaced the inherited `transition: all` with
           targeted transitions on chrome), and every transition still running
           at this moment targets an element @media print hides - measured 31
           running, 0 of them visible under the print stylesheet.
           So the double rAF is sufficient BY ACCIDENT OF THE STYLESHEET, not
           by construction, and that is exactly why it needs pinning: adding
           `transition: background-color` to a printed surface would silently
           start capturing half-faded colours, with the settled measurement
           below still reporting everything correct.
           RECORDED ONLY WHEN THE SIGNAL REALLY ARRIVED. This used to be an
           unconditional assignment after the timeout branch, which made the
           whole assertion FAIL OPEN in the one regression it exists for: if
           the handler stopped emitting `pdf-export-ready`, the probe ran 15
           seconds later against a fully settled page, `readyDiffs` came back
           empty, six entries existed, and an assertion named "the page is
           already settled the instant the export reports ready" passed for six
           states in which nothing had reported ready. The outcome and the

       Without it the whole check failed open on a handler that stopped

       (2) The CAUSE arm: no animation that the print stylesheet actually
       paints may be running at that instant. This is the real invariant and
       it does not depend on when the sample lands.
       (3) The SYMPTOM arm: no sampled colour may differ from its settled
       value. This one DOES depend on the probe's IPC latency - it can only

       Stripping comments removes the entire prose false-positive class at its

         template toggles the quote state twice, and an ODD number of toggles
         would leave the scanner desynchronised and start eating real code as
         comments. Balanced nesting must come back in sync, which is what the

       shortest path to the state being measured - but it means the surface the
       user actually touches has never been exercised: the hamburger, the View
       flyout, the grace-period hover that reveals the panel, the per-row click
       listeners, the tick bookkeeping and the dismissal are all unproven. A
       scheme layer that is perfect and unreachable ships as no feature at all,

       REACHABILITY IS HIT-TESTED, NOT INFERRED FROM CLASSES. HTMLElement
       .click() fires the listener on a row that is zero-sized, clipped or
       buried under another panel, so a class-and-callback test would report a
       working menu for one the mouse can never land on. Each row is therefore
       resolved through document.elementFromPoint() at its own centre, and the
       probe is made two-sided by running the identical sweep with the menu
       CLOSED and requiring it to find nothing - otherwise a probe that says
       "reachable" unconditionally looks exactly like a healthy menu.
       (Known and accepted limit, same as test-visual-utils.js records:
       elementFromPoint ignores pointer-events:none, so a decorative overlay is

       "did markActive() mark the right row" and nothing else. What turns that
       class into something a reader can see is a handful of CSS rules in
       custom-styles.css, and MEASURED by deleting the tick rule outright, the
       whole suite stayed green at 242/242: every row lost its checkmark, the
       menu became unreadable, and not one assertion moved.
       So this measures the RENDERED form of the same claim. R340 is that exact
       edit, kept permanently.

       LABEL ALIGNMENT IS THE STRONGER HALF, and it is why the gutter is
       checked by geometry rather than by reading any declaration. This
       assertion FAILED on its first run and named a real product defect: the
       rows inherit `justify-content: space-between` from .tools-submenu-item,
       which pushed every tick to the far left edge and every label to the far
       right, so the labels formed a 64px-ragged column and each tick sat ~140px
       from the row it marked. Both halves of the fix are load-bearing - packing
       from the start edge, and giving the ::before a WIDTH so a ticked and an
       unticked row reserve the same space - and reverting either one alone is
       enough to misalign the column, which is why R341 and R342 are separate.
       A Range over a SCHEME row's contents measures where the text really
       begins - the pseudo is not part of it - so nothing here restates a
       length. A MODE row is not the same shape: its first child is an inline
       SVG, so the same Range starts at the icon. That number is kept, named
       for the gutter it actually measures, and the mode label is read
       separately from its own text node. */

      /* THE PROBE'S OWN PRECONDITION, MEASURED RATHER THAN INHERITED. Every
         geometric claim below is read off getBoundingClientRect, and a closed
         submenu is display:none - so every rect collapses to zero, every label
         inset becomes exactly 0, and the alignment spread reads a perfect 0.
         A vacuous pass and a perfect result are the same number here, which is
         the one shape this project treats as unacceptable. The section leaves
         the menu open above; this records that it really was, so a future edit
         that reorders the section fails loudly instead of silently measuring
         an unpainted menu.

         THE SIZE CHECK IS THE LOAD-BEARING HALF AND 'open' ALONE WOULD NOT
         DO - measured, not assumed. R363 dismisses the menu through the
         product's own document.body.click() path and the probe still reports
         open=true: that click closes the PARENT dropdown, and nothing
         removes 'theme-open' from the item (custom-theme.js drops it only on a
         row click or the 200ms hover grace timer). So the class outlives the
         painted panel, and only the rects can tell. Both are reported so a
         failure names which half went.

       misalignment the fixed width exists to prevent, and it is invisible to
       every resting measurement above.

       rule is measured under it. The perturbation is undone and the undo is
       itself asserted, since a stranded max-width would silently reshape every
       later measurement.

    /* ── 10k. ONE STORED-MODE RESOLVER ─────────────────────────────────────
       The legacy-'darkMode' migration rule used to be written down five times:
       once in renderer.js's resolveDarkPreference() - which decides the dark
       CLASS - and four times in custom-theme.js as a bare
       `localStorage.getItem('themeMode') || 'desktop'`, which does NOT consult
       the legacy key. On a profile that has only ever run the legacy build the
       two therefore answer differently, and the difference is not academic:
       measured, with the OS resolving light, the class said dark while the
       scheme sites said light, so `data-theme` landed on a LIGHT scheme
       (parchment, body background rgb(244,239,228)) underneath `.dark-mode`.

       THAT STATE IS NOT REACHABLE IN THE SHIPPED APP TODAY, and this comment
       says so rather than overselling the fix: applyTheme() is the only writer
       of 'themeMode' and init() calls it unconditionally, so a stored scheme
       implies a stored mode. It was one deleted migration block away, and the
       resolvers really did disagree - which is what this section measures.

       The state is forced rather than waited for, and window.matchMedia is
       stubbed to answer LIGHT so the legacy value ('dark') and the raw
       fallback ('desktop' -> OS) cannot agree by accident on this machine.
       Assertion 2 is the positive control for exactly that: if the stub failed
       the two answers would coincide and every assertion below would pass for
       the wrong reason.

       Four of the five sites are driven through real product functions. The
       fifth - markActive()'s `mode || storedMode()` - has a single caller and
       that caller always passes a mode, so its fallback is unreachable and is
       left unified without an independent pin. */

    // ─── 10m. CHROME FIDELITY AGAINST THE BASELINE COMMIT ───────────────────
    /* THE HARD CONSTRAINT, FOR THE SURFACES THE GOLDEN NEVER REACHED. Both
       models of a review round independently reported the same gap and it was
       real: theme-golden.json's `surfaces` map holds exactly ten selectors,
       all of them `body` or `#viewer`. Every chrome surface this work
       TOKENISED - the header, the search panel and its buttons and counter,
       the loading overlay, the welcome buttons and icons, the update banner,
       the toggle track - had its literal replaced by a var() with nothing
       comparing the result to what the app used to paint. A one-digit typo in
       any of them ships silently under a requirement that says the two
       defaults must look exactly as they did.

       IT IS DERIVED, NOT LISTED, and that is the whole point. A hand-written
       table of "chrome tokens to check" is a subject list chosen by the same
       person who wrote the code, and this project has been bitten four times
       by coverage narrower than the claim it is named for. Instead the
       baseline stylesheets are read straight out of the pinned commit and
       EVERY declaration in them is the subject. A new tokenised surface joins
       this assertion by existing; nobody has to remember it.

       THE COMPARISON IS DONE AFTER SUBSTITUTION, not token by token. Some
       tokens hold only a fragment of the value they serve - the update
       banner's glow is `rgba(var(--accent-mode-glow-rgb), 0.3)` inside a
       box-shadow, and the tint is an alpha over a colour - so comparing token
       values would need a per-token rule about what the token means. Resolving
       the whole declaration and comparing the RESULT compares what is painted,
       which is the thing the requirement is actually about. The var values are
       read from the LIVE cascade in each frozen default, so a scheme leaking
       into a default fails this too. */

    /* ── 10o. THE MODE ROWS AND THE OS-FOLLOWING PATH ──────────────────────
       BOTH REVIEWERS FOUND THIS HOLE INDEPENDENTLY, from opposite ends. The
       whole of 10j drives `.custom-scheme-option` rows and nothing had ever
       clicked a `.custom-theme-option` (mode) row, so applyTheme() through a
       real click, the tick moving, and the dismissal after a mode pick were
       unproven; and the `change` listener init() registers on the OS media
       query had no coverage of any kind, so a reader on "Follow Desktop"
       could stop following at sunset with every assertion green.

       THE OS FLIP IS REAL, NOT STUBBED. window.matchMedia returns a fresh
       MediaQueryList per call, so dispatching `change` on a new instance would
       not reach the listener the product registered on ITS instance - the test
       would pass against a copy of the mechanism rather than the mechanism.
       Emulation.setEmulatedMedia flips prefers-color-scheme in the engine, so
       the real listener fires for the real reason. That is also why this
       section owns its own debugger attach/detach rather than borrowing
       10i's: the two must not overlap. */

       "Follow Desktop" row - the only one whose mode is not a scheme mode and
       the only one that reaches resolveMode()'s matchMedia branch from the
       menu - were unproven end to end. applyTheme is deliberately NOT exported
       on window.foliaThemes, so clicking is not merely the realistic path, it
       is the only one.

    // ─── 10n. THE TOGGLE SWITCH, THE ONE THEMED CONTROL WITH NO TEXT ────────
    /* IT HAD NO ASSERTION AT ALL AND IT SHIPPED STOCK LIGHT BLUE UNDER EVERY
       SCHEME. `.tools-toggle-item.active .tools-toggle-track` was a hardcoded
       #4fc3f7 - a colour belonging to no palette in this product - so every
       scheme painted the same sky blue against its own menu. No prior section
       could see it: it carries no text, so the contrast sweeps score nothing
       on it; it is not a hover or focus rule, so 10g never collects it; and it
       is not an accent literal, so the stranded-accent sweep does not know the
       value.

       IT IS SCORED AGAINST WCAG 1.4.11 (3:1, non-text contrast), which is the
       APPLICABLE standard - deliberately not 4.5:1 "to be safe", because a
       bar the standard never set would reject a future scheme for no reason.
       FOUR relations, and all four are needed: a track that disappears into
       the menu cannot be found, a track that disappears into the menu's HOVER
       fill cannot be found while the reader is pointing at it, a track that
       disappears behind its own thumb cannot be read, and an ON track that
       matches the OFF track carries no information at all, which is the
       entire job of a switch.

       THE UNIQUENESS CLAUSE HAS TWO HALVES AND ONLY THE FIRST WAS OBVIOUS.
       Distinctness across the four schemes catches one scheme copying
       ANOTHER's track. It does NOT catch the realistic accident - a scheme
       that was never given a track at all and inherits the frozen default's
       stock blue - because that value is distinct from all four. R389 came
       back WRONG-GUARD on exactly that hole: it pointed abyss back at
       #4fc3f7 and the set stayed size 4. Hence the explicit FROZEN_TOGGLE
       comparison beside it. */

               something else, and 10m would see no drift because the base rule

               #fullscreenToggle is the subject on purpose - it is the ONLY
               user-visible toggle switch left in the app. #darkModeToggle is

               off, so no toggle would otherwise be in the on state at all.

               this project: a colour read while a transition is running is the
               PREVIOUS state's colour, and it is indistinguishable from a real

       THE COPY BUTTON'S CONFIRMATION FILL - a themed ink painted onto a
       surface no scheme could reach.

       .code-copy-btn is fully tokenised (background var(--primary-color),
       color var(--on-accent-fg)). Its .copied override - the ~2s "Copied!"
       confirmation after a click - repainted ONLY the background, with a raw
       #27ae60 (#2ecc71 on hover). So all six states went on supplying the INK
       for a fill they had no way to influence, and the four white-ink states
       landed at 2.87:1 resting and 2.10:1 on hover.

       IT WAS PROVEN UNCOVERED BEFORE IT WAS FIXED, rather than assumed to be:
       planting a 1.0:1 fill in ONE scheme - leaving the frozen defaults
       untouched, so the fidelity sweeps could not mask the result - left the
       suite green at 351/351. Each existing section misses it for its own
       reason: 10d reads a RESTING document, where no .copied button exists;
       10g collects the hover rule but excuses it (HOVER_EXCUSALS) for the
       same reason; and the state sweep does scaffold one, but it compares
       against the BASELINE, which a raw literal reproduces perfectly. A
       surface can be covered three times over and still have no assertion
       asking whether a scheme can reach it at all. */
