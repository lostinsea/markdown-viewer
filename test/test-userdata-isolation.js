// Give every Electron test suite its own userData directory, wiped on entry.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS
// ---------------
// The suites used to run against the developer's REAL profile
// (%APPDATA%/Folia). That profile is where custom-tabs.js persists the open-tab
// session (saveTabs -> localStorage "openTabs"), so the harness both INHERITED
// and CONTAMINATED whatever the developer had open. Measured consequences:
//
//   * test-startup-perf.js is the one suite that requires ../src/main.js, so it
//     is the one suite where main.js's ipcMain "confirm-large-render" handler is
//     registered. main.js opens a real window; the renderer restores the saved
//     session; a restored tab holding an EXPENSIVE document reaches
//     confirmLargeTab() -> sendSync -> askAboutLargeDocument() ->
//     dialog.showMessageBoxSync(). That dialog is modal IN THE MAIN PROCESS, so
//     nothing in a test can dismiss it - the process that would run the stub is
//     the process that is blocked. The suite stalls until a human clicks.
//     A/B measured: seeded profile = hang with zero assertions; empty profile =
//     7/7 in 8s. Same command, same tree.
//
//   * One killed run planted that landmine for every LATER run: a tab is
//     persisted by saveTabs() the moment it is created, long before the
//     scenario's cleanup closes it.
//
//   * The leak ran the other way too - a packaged smoke-test path of mine was
//     found sitting in the developer's real session.
//
// This is the fourth instance of the same disease in this project (window
// bounds, splitter ratio, an mdv-probe temp dir resolving a relative <img>).
// Each previous one was fixed by seeding the specific state the suite needed.
// This fixes the CLASS: a suite can no longer read, or write, anything the
// developer's app owns.
//
// WHY IT WIPES RATHER THAN JUST REDIRECTS
// ---------------------------------------
// Isolation alone would still let a crashed run poison its own next run, which
// is exactly the failure above with a smaller blast radius. Starting from an
// empty directory makes every suite's session state a function of that suite,
// not of its history.
//
// ORDERING IS LOAD-BEARING, SO IT FAILS LOUD
// ------------------------------------------
// app.setPath("userData", ...) only relocates the profile if it runs before the
// app is ready. Called too late it is silently ignored - an absence assertion
// that fails open, the exact class of defect this project keeps finding. So
// this module ABORTS if it is required after app.isReady(), and aborts again if
// the path did not actually move.
//
// "FAILS LOUD" MUST NOT MEAN `throw`, AND THAT IS NOT A STYLE POINT
// -----------------------------------------------------------------
// This module used to throw. Electron converts an exception raised while the
// main process is loading into dialog.showErrorBox - a MODAL, owned by the
// process that is failing. In a headless run nobody clicks it, so the suite
// does not fail: it HANGS, forever, holding the whole chain. Measured: a run
// stalled 42 minutes on a window titled "Error" and had to be killed by PID;
// `npm test` then reported exit=-1 with no totals. That is the precise opposite
// of failing loud, and it is the same modal-blocks-the-only-process shape this
// file's own header already documents for confirm-large-render.
// So every fatal path below writes to fd 2 with writeSync - process.exit can
// truncate a buffered stderr write on Windows - and exits non-zero.
//
// WHY THE WIPE RETRIES
// --------------------
// The directory name is per-suite but FIXED, so a still-dying Electron process
// from an earlier run - or any other process that boots Electron against this
// repo at the same time - can hold a handle inside it and turn the wipe into
// EPERM. Node's own rmSync retries exactly this error class (EBUSY, EMFILE,
// ENFILE, ENOTEMPTY, EPERM) with linear backoff when given maxRetries, which is
// the ecosystem's answer to Windows lock races and is used here in preference
// to a hand-rolled sleep loop.
//
// The name deliberately stays fixed rather than becoming unique per run. A
// unique directory is always empty, which would make test-startup-perf.js's
// "the suite booted from a profile with no inherited session" assertion
// (POST_WIPE_ENTRIES === 0) true by construction and therefore incapable of
// failing - trading a race for a permanently vacuous assertion.
