/**
 * Shared visual-check helpers for the Electron test harnesses.
 *
 * Why this exists
 * ---------------
 * The mermaid harness once passed 17 geometry assertions while the diagrams
 * were visually unreadable, and the bug was only found by looking at a
 * screenshot. The lesson was NOT "add pixel-diff baselines" - those are flaky
 * across GPU drivers, DPI and Electron versions, they say "something changed"
 * rather than "this is wrong", and they cannot express intent (white boxes are
 * correct in light mode). The lesson was:
 *
 *   screenshots find unknown-unknowns; assertions guard known invariants.
 *
 * So this module provides the two halves of that:
 *
 *   1. inspect() - a DOM probe for the things a human notices in a screenshot
 *      but that computed styles alone do not catch: an element being
 *      off-screen, collapsed to nothing, covered by something else, or clipped
 *      by an ancestor. These become ordinary deterministic assertions.
 *
 *   2. captureScreenshot() - screenshots as *artifacts*, never as baselines.
 *      Written to a gitignored screenshots/ directory on every run and on
 *      failure, so a human (or an agent that can read images) can look at them
 *      when something breaks. Nothing asserts on their contents.
 *
 * Anything discovered via (2) should be converted into an assertion in (1) so
 * that the same bug can never need a screenshot again.

// Survive a closed stdout.
//
// Every suite reports through console.log. If the reader on the other end of
// the pipe goes away first - `| head`, `| Select-Object -First 20`, a killed
// pager, a CI step that stops consuming - the next write raises EPIPE. In a
// plain Node script that is a stack trace; under Electron the main process
// turns an uncaught exception into a MODAL DIALOG that blocks the run until a
// human clicks OK, which is exactly the opposite of what a test harness should
// do on a machine with no one watching. Observed for real:
//   Error: EPIPE: broken pipe, write ... at check (test-table-display.js:41)
//
// Losing output nobody is reading is harmless; hanging the suite is not. So
// swallow EPIPE specifically and let every other stream error surface. This is
// installed here rather than in each suite because all eight require this
// module, and it must be armed before the first assertion prints.
//
// A/B PROVEN, not assumed. An Electron script printing a line every 30ms into a
// pipe whose reader exits after the first chunk:
//   without this guard - the run HANGS indefinitely behind a window titled
//                        "Error" (observed as electron pid 25684) and has to be
//                        killed; stderr never even flushes.
//   with this guard    - runs to completion, no dialog, no stray process.
// Note that plain `node` does NOT reproduce it: Console defaults to
// ignoreErrors:true, so a bare Node script survives a closed stdout on its own.
// It is specifically Electron's uncaught-exception dialog that turns this into
// a hang, which is why the isolated Node reproduction was misleading at first.

// Keep the window laying out even when the desktop covers it.
//
// Chromium on Windows computes *native window occlusion*: when another window
// fully covers the app, the page is marked hidden
// (`document.visibilityState === "hidden"`) and layout is suspended to save
// work. That is correct behaviour for a real app and a disaster for a
// geometric test harness, because a suspended page stops updating
// `window.innerWidth` while the OS-level bounds keep tracking every resize.
//
// MEASURED, not inferred. Under a full `npm test` the table suite reported:
//   requested width 2000, outerWidth 2000, contentWidth 1988  (main process: correct)
//   innerWidth 988, documentElement.clientWidth 988           (renderer: frozen)
//   win.isVisible() true, isMinimized() false, focused true
//   document.hidden TRUE, visibilityState "hidden"            <- the actual cause
// The window really had resized; the page had simply stopped laying out. Ten
// geometric assertions then failed naming TABLES, and the same suite passed
// 95/95 in isolation - because in isolation nothing was covering the window.
//
// A/B proven with a forced-occlusion probe (a second opaque always-on-top
// window fully covering the target, then a resize of the covered window):
//   STOCK          hiddenWhileCovered=true   outerWidth STALE at 1200 after a
//                                            resize to 1900
//   WITH SWITCHES  hiddenWhileCovered=false  outerWidth 1900 (correct)
// Note the probe froze `outerWidth` where the suite froze `innerWidth`: WHICH
// renderer-side window metric goes stale is not fixed, so the invariant worth
// stating is the general one - an occluded page stops updating its own view of
// the window, and these switches stop the page being marked occluded at all.
//
// Disabled here rather than in each suite because every Electron harness
// requires this module, and rather than in main.js because the product should
// keep normal occlusion behaviour - this is a property of the test
// environment, not of the app.
//
// Three switches, because they cover three different mechanisms and the first
// alone is not enough on every Electron version:
//   CalculateNativeWinOcclusion - the Windows occlusion calculation itself
//   disable-backgrounding-occluded-windows - throttling once occluded
//   disable-renderer-backgrounding - throttling of non-foreground renderers
//
// `disable-features` is a VALUE switch, and appendSwitch REPLACES the value
// rather than adding to it. MEASURED, because the wording of the API suggests
// otherwise:
//   appendSwitch("disable-features", "FeatureAlpha")  -> "FeatureAlpha"
//   appendSwitch("disable-features", "FeatureBeta")   -> "FeatureBeta"   (!)
//   appendSwitch("disable-features", "Alpha,Beta")    -> "Alpha,Beta"
// So a second caller anywhere - a future suite, a product feature, a
// dependency - would silently switch this one back on, and the failure would
// surface as unexplained geometric flakiness rather than as anything naming
// occlusion. Merge with whatever is already there instead of assuming this is
// the only caller. The other two are boolean switches and stack fine.

// Keep the suite inside its own window.
//
// The app hands external links to the operating system: renderer.js does
// `shell.openExternal(url)` for any http(s) anchor, and again for the logo. A
// suite that dispatches a REAL click on a REAL anchor - which is exactly what
// this project's rules demand, since asserting on source text proves nothing -
// therefore launches the user's default browser.
//
// REPORTED BY THE USER, not theorised: every `npm run test:patch` opened
// https://example.invalid/x in whatever browser they were working in, stealing
// focus from the page they were on, and the tabs accumulated - one per suite
// run, and a full revert-proof chain runs the suite dozens of times.
//
// Two properties matter here beyond politeness:
//   * a harness that reaches OUT of its process is not hermetic. The run's
//     result now depends on a browser, a default-handler registration and a
//     network stack that no assertion describes.
//   * the leak was SILENT. Nothing failed, so it survived until a human
//     noticed their tab bar.
//
// So the trap is installed centrally rather than at the one call site known to
// leak today. The renderer copy is what has to be patched: `shell.openExternal`
// in a nodeIntegration renderer is a proxy that reaches the browser process
// over internal IPC, so patching the main process's own `shell` module does
// NOT intercept it (measured - main.js never calls openExternal at all, and
// the leak still happened).
//
// `shell.openPath` is trapped for the same reason, and it is the WORSE of the
// two: it hands a path to the OS shell, which launches the registered
// application - a PDF viewer, Explorer, an editor. renderer.js reaches it from
// the local-file branch of the same anchor handler, so a future test that
// clicks a link resolving to a .txt or a folder would start launching
// applications on the user's desktop. Only the security suite stubbed it, and
// only locally.
//
// A RELOAD DROPS THE TRAP, AND THAT WAS MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED.
// test-mermaid-render.js reloads the window mid-suite to get a clean JS realm.
// A probe across that reload reported:
//   before  { flag: true,  openExternalPatched: true  }
//   after   { flag: false, openExternalPatched: false }
// - both the marker and the patched function are gone, because the realm and
// its `require('electron')` module instance are rebuilt. Every assertion after
// that point ran with the real opener live again. A one-shot install is
// therefore not enough: the trap re-arms itself on every `did-finish-load`, so
// no suite has to remember to re-apply it after a reload or a navigation.
//
// Suites that want to ASSERT an external open read `readExternalOpens(win)`.
// That is strictly better than the alternative of letting the real call
// through: the assertion gets the exact URL instead of inferring the open from
// a side effect it cannot see.

// Temp directories that are removed however the suite ends.
//
// THE DEFECT THIS FIXES IS NOT "the suites are untidy". Every suite except
// test-popup-security's download probe already called fs.rmSync on its temp
// dir - but on the NORMAL COMPLETION PATH ONLY. Read test-tab-refresh.js's
// tail: the rmSync sits between the summary line and the final app.exit, so
// the 180s watchdog's app.exit(1), the "no BrowserWindow was created" bail and
// any throw that escapes all skip it. The runs that leak are therefore exactly
// the runs that already went wrong, which is the worst possible correlation:
// a timeout leaves debris, and the debris makes the next run worse.
//
// MEASURED on this machine before writing any of this - stale dirs by prefix:
//   mdv-dl-   34   test-popup-security.js:1250, never cleaned at all
//   mdv-e2e-  13   test-tab-refresh.js:25, cleaned only on the happy path
//   mdv-sec- / mdv-search- / mdv-patch- / mdv-mermaid-   ZERO
// The zeros are the control: those four suites had been ending normally, so
// their existing cleanup ran. Same code shape, different outcome, and the
// difference is entirely which exit path was taken.
//
// A LEAKED TEMP DIR IS NOT INERT, which is what makes this worth structural
// work rather than a manual sweep. The hermeticity investigation found 43
// orphaned mdv-e2e-* dirs of which exactly ONE still held guard-big.md - the
// 260 KB fixture that, once persisted into the then-shared Electron session,
// raised a main-process modal on startup and blocked EVERY subsequent suite
// behind a dialog no in-process watchdog could clear.
//
// WHY process.on("exit") IS THE RIGHT HOOK, and it was measured rather than
// assumed - the concern is real, because app.exit() is documented to terminate
// immediately and does NOT emit will-quit or quit:
//   probe A (npx electron): app.exit(0) after whenReady
//                           -> seen: ["process:exit"]   will-quit/quit ABSENT
//   probe B: three nested dirs (subdirs + a 64 KB file) removed with a
//            recursive rmSync inside that same handler
//                           -> removed 3, failed [], goneAfter [t,t,t],
//                              0 stragglers left on disk
//   probe C: a try/finally wrapped directly around that same app.exit(0)
//                           -> seen: ["process:exit"] ONLY - neither the
//                              statement after app.exit() nor the `finally`
//                              block ran at all
// So the handler runs and a recursive removal COMPLETES inside it, which is
// the claim that actually matters - a half-executed sweep during teardown
// would look identical from the outside.
//
// PROBE C IS WHY THIS REGISTRY EXISTS AT ALL, and it is what splits the two
// tiers of suite. app.exit() terminates mid-stack and unwinds nothing, so a
// try/finally CANNOT clean up an Electron suite - which is exactly the shape
// of the leak: the rmSync sits on the normal-completion path and is skipped by
// the watchdog app.exit(1), the no-window bail and any escaping throw. The
// plain-node suites have the opposite property (no app, so `finally` always
// runs) and already use it: test-packaging.js cleans all three of its temp

// AND THE HOOK ALONE DOES NOT COVER THE PATH THAT MATTERS MOST. Probe A above
// was recorded as proving "app.exit() runs process.on('exit')". That is only
// CONDITIONALLY true, and probe A hid the condition by reaching app.exit from
// a setTimeout. Re-measured, five contexts, all inside whenReady().then(...):
//   app.exit(0) called synchronously in the then callback  handler DID NOT run
//   queueMicrotask(() => app.exit(0))                      handler DID NOT run
//   Promise.resolve().then(() => app.exit(0))              handler DID NOT run
//   setImmediate(() => app.exit(0))                        handler ran
//   setTimeout(() => app.exit(0), 0)                       handler ran
// and four realistic suite shapes:
//   await Promise.resolve(); app.exit(0)                   handler DID NOT run
//   await sleep(0) / await sleep(50); app.exit(0)          handler ran
//   new BrowserWindow(); await win.loadURL(u); app.exit(0) handler ran
// Repeated 5x per shape with the full child payload: the microtask exit wrote
// its report 0/5 times, the setImmediate exit 5/5.
//
// THE AXIS IS WHETHER app.exit() IS REACHED WHILE STILL INSIDE THE READY
// EVENT'S OWN NATIVE DISPATCH - within the microtask checkpoint that drains at
// the end of it. Any macrotask boundary (a timer, a window load, real IPC)
// moves the call out of that dispatch and the handlers run normally. Every
// windowed suite loads a window, so the hook does cover today's tails - but an
// early bail-out ("no BrowserWindow was created") is exactly the shape that
// exits inside that first dispatch, and it is also exactly the run that has
// already gone wrong, which is the correlation this whole section exists for.
//
// So the sweep ALSO runs from app.exit itself, synchronously, before
// delegating. That is deterministic whichever dispatch the call is reached
// from, and process.on("exit") stays as the backstop for every other exit path
// (a natural return, process.exit, plain-node use). app.on("will-quit") is NOT
// an option: app.exit() does not emit it (probe A). The two are idempotent
// together - sweepTempDirs clears the registry, so the second call finds
// nothing and the counter cannot double-count.
