  // both. Neither is an injection today - every restore runs BEFORE
  // sanitizeHtml() - but both are document-controlled corruption, and one
  // sanitize reorder away from being worse.
  //
  //  (a) The token is a PREDICTABLE LITERAL and the restore rewrites only the
  //      FIRST occurrence (String.replace with a string, and a non-global
  //      RegExp, both stop at one). The token contains no HTML-special
  //      character, so a decoy in a code span survives marked verbatim. If the
  //      decoy comes first, the real block is spliced into the reader's code
  //      span and the genuine token is left on screen as literal text. Same
  //      shape as SEC-28, on a different carrier.
  //
  //  (b) $-EXPANSION, and it reaches the two MERMAID sites only. A replacement
  //      STRING gives $&, $`, $' and $$ their special meaning, and the mermaid
  //      replacement embeds escapeHtml(code) - which does not escape $. The
  //      @@@html sites are immune because rawHtmlIframeMarkup()'s only variable
  //      part is a hash.
  //
  // The two paths spell their tokens DIFFERENTLY (MERMAID_PLACEHOLDER_ /
  // RAWHTML_PLACEHOLDER_ on the full path, MERMAID_PH_ / RAWHTML_PH_ on the
  // light one), so each leg has to plant the token its own path will look for.
  // That divergence is itself the reason a shared helper is the right fix.
  //
  // ORACLE NOTE, and the obvious one is WRONG for the mermaid leg: <pre> is in
  // the set of start tags that close an open <p>, so the parser REPARENTS the
  // spliced pre.mermaid out of the code span. "the diagram ended up inside a
  // <code>" therefore cannot be the test. What survives the reparenting is the
  // damage to the reader's own text: the code span is emptied and the real
  // token is stranded as visible prose. Both are asserted, with the mermaid /
  // iframe counts as positive controls - all three oracles are absence checks,
  // and an absence check fails open.

  // ever asked to match ONE digit. Reaching a two-digit index through the
  // public render path costs eleven diagrams per leg, which buys nothing the
  // helper cannot show more precisely - so this exercises createBlockPlaceholders
  // itself, in the live renderer page, with no render at all.
  //
  // It is also STRICTLY STRONGER than the page could be, in three ways:
  //
  //  - THE ORACLE IS THE EXACT RESTORED STRING, not a regex extract plus
  //    counts. An extract of `[PAYLOAD-n]` matches just as happily when the
  //    restore leaves a trailing `_` behind after every replacement, which is
  //    precisely what dropping the index terminator does. A full compare
  //    cannot miss it.
  //  - the @@@html half's index-to-payload identity is unobservable in the
  //    page: eleven iframes carry eleven srcdoc documents of near-identical
  //    length, so a DOM fixture can assert only that each was funded, never
  //    WHICH body each received.
  //  - the `unwrapParagraph` shape is a DIFFERENT REGEX (`<p>core</p>|core`,
  //    two capture groups, so the callback reads a different argument), and
  //    only here can the paragraph be shown swallowed for EVERY block rather
  //    than for the first frame the page happens to expose.
  //
  // MEASURED against this same restore, all five index patterns, 12 blocks,
  // both `unwrapParagraph` shapes:
  //
  //   (\d+)_   shipped              0..11 correct, no debris
  //   (\d+?)_  lazy, terminated     0..11 correct, no debris - INERT, so it is
  //                                 deliberately not recorded as a revert
  //   (\d+)    greedy, no term.     0..11 correct, ONE '_' left per block, and
  //                                 the <p> alternative stops matching  (R532)
  //   (\d+?)   lazy, no terminator  10 and 11 both receive BLOCK 1            (R533)
  //   (\d)_    single digit         0..9 restored, 10 and 11 STRANDED         (R538)
  //
  // So the terminator is NOT a mapping guard - the greedy `(\d+)` already makes
  // the ..._1_ / ..._10_ collision unreachable, and laziness alone is inert
  // because the terminator forces the backtrack that recovers the second digit.
  // What the terminator does is end the token cleanly, and that is what R532

  // N11 - the click delegation was not TOTAL, and the hole was shaped like a

  //
  // Three arms decide what a click does: `#...` anchors, then http(s), then
  // local files. The http(s) arm tests the RESOLVED url (`link.href`); the
  // local-file arm tested the raw href ATTRIBUTE for `startsWith('http')`. A
  // sibling file called `httpd.md` or `https-notes.txt` satisfies NEITHER - the
  // attribute begins "http" so the local arm skipped it, and it resolves to
  // `file:` so the http arm skipped it too. No preventDefault ran, Chromium
  // followed the link natively, and main.js's will-navigate deny killed the
  // navigation. Net effect for the reader: the link does nothing at all, in
  // silence, with no notification and nothing in the renderer console.
  //
  // These are ordinary filenames - `httpd.conf`, `http-api.md`, `https-setup.md`
  // are exactly the sort of sibling a documentation repo contains - so this is
  // a real "some of my links are dead" bug, not a curiosity.
  //
  // The hrefs below are deliberately BARE (`httpd.md`, not `./httpd.md`). The
  // first draft of this block used the `./` form and all three assertions
  // passed against the unfixed code, because `./httpd.md` does not begin with
  // "http" and so took the local arm normally. The `./` prefix is optional in
  // markdown and most authors omit it, which is precisely why the bug is
  // reachable - and why the assertion has to pin the exact href it clicked.
  //
  // The third assertion is the one that guards the FIX rather than the bug: the
  // local arm is now a genuine catch-all, so it must be proved that an absolute
  // http(s) URL is still taken by the arm above it and never treated as a path.
  // `exists.length === 0` is the load-bearing conjunct there - if the catch-all

  // Whitespace-only hrefs. The handler tests emptiness with URL_BLANK

  // which an earlier version of this comment claimed) while the local-file arm
  // trims separately, so in principle the two could disagree about a `&nbsp;`,
  // a BOM or a C0 control and let a "blank" href reach the path resolver.
  //
  // MEASURED, AND THE MEASUREMENT IS THE FINDING: they cannot disagree, but
  // NOT for the reason the first draft of this comment gave. The mechanism is
  // DOMPurify's own `stringTrim(initValue)` on every attribute value
  // (purify.js:1917 in the vendored 3.4.12), followed by the validity check's
  // final `else if (value) return false` (purify.js:1805-1806), which
  // explicitly KEEPS an attribute whose value is empty. Native String.trim()
  // is the filter, so the two predicates split the carriers into two different
  // outcomes rather than one:
  //
  //   \u00A0, \uFEFF - inside JS's trim set, so DOMPurify trims them to "" and
  //     keeps the attribute. `hrefAttr === ""`, where URL_BLANK and trim()
  //     trivially agree.
  //   \u0001 - a C0 control. URL_BLANK calls it blank; JS trim() does NOT, so
  //     it SURVIVES the trim, then fails IS_ALLOWED_URI, and the ATTRIBUTE IS
  //     REMOVED ENTIRELY. The anchor is then not a link at all: `link.href` is
  //     "" and the handler's outer guard rejects it before either predicate is
  //     evaluated.
  //
  // So the direction where URL_BLANK is broader than trim() is unreachable
  // because the attribute is DELETED, not because it is emptied - and note the
  // irony that the predicate R468 proposed swapping IN is the one the sanitizer
  // already applies. This is why the DOM premise is asserted SEPARATELY from
  // the behaviour: the behavioural assertion below is true for reasons that
  // have nothing to do with URL_BLANK, and a reader who saw only that assertion
  // would credit the wrong code. It is also why the revert that swapped
  // URL_BLANK for a bare trim() was withdrawn as vacuous rather than recorded
  // as proven: the property is real, but it is unobservable from the DOM.

  // below ran against Chromium's blocked page, where neither `require` nor
  // `window.__n11SavedExternal` exists, and threw."

  // REFUTED BY MEASUREMENT. Under R463 the frame is destroyed by the `caps`
  // carrier, which is the SECOND of four that navigate - the two SVG carriers
  // follow it and both report `alive:true`, because n11Click calls
  // n11EnsureAlive first and the recovery had already rebuilt the document. So
  // `alive0` is true by the time this line runs, this guard returns
  // immediately, and the restore exec below has always succeeded: its own
  // assertion, `the local openExternal stub is fully removed and the shared
  // trap answers again`, PASSES under R463. The abort was twenty lines further
  // on, in SEC-13, on `window.__e2eErrors.length = 0` - a SUITE-level global
  // the recovery reload destroyed and did not reinstall. See E2E_SENTINEL at
  // the top of this file.
  //
  // THE GUARD STAYS ANYWAY, on the R202 precedent that an unreachable guard is
  // still a contract: no carrier is currently last-and-fatal, but that is a
  // property of which reverts exist today, not of the teardown.
  //
  // WHAT REMAINS TRUE, AND IS THE REASON ANY OF THIS MATTERED: aborting
  // anywhere in this file means every later block simply never runs, so its
  // assertions cannot fail - they cease to exist. That is exactly what the
  // long-standing R463 anomaly was: `SEC-11 an <area href> is routed through
  // the link policy, not Chromium` was reported as `missing=` and read as a
  // wrong guard about <area> handling, when in fact the assertion had never
  // been reached. An aborted suite is indistinguishable from a passing one for
  // every assertion after the abort point. With the sentinel reinstalled the

  // NOT a navigation, so main.js's will-navigate / will-redirect /
  // will-frame-navigate / setWindowOpenHandler denies never see it, and CSP has
  // no directive that governs one. Inside #viewer the attribute was already

  // routes the link to shell.openExternal - but #tableInsertPreview sits
  // OUTSIDE #viewer and had no delegation. Measured before the fix: a download
  // anchor rendered there issued a live outbound HTTP request from the
  // Node-privileged renderer to a loopback beacon, while a plain anchor in the
  // same click batch was blocked by will-navigate.
