Inline `code span` and a [link](https://example.com).

Inline highlighted code: <code class="language-javascript">const x = 1;</code> —
this is NOT a hypothetical. `class` is in the sanitizer's ADD_ATTR
(src/renderer.js), so raw HTML like this survives DOMPurify and renders as a
`code[class*="language-"]` that is NOT inside a `<pre>`. PrismJS supports that
shape deliberately, which is why its themes ship a
`:not(pre) > code[class*="language-"]` rule. It is measured because it is the
one code surface whose box comes from a DIFFERENT set of rules than the block
form, so `pre`/`pre code` cannot stand in for it.

## Reading surfaces

> A blockquote line.

| Head | Other |

| c | d |

A code block with no author-supplied language:

<pre id="census-nolang"><code>plain preformatted text
no language class anywhere</code></pre>

Raw HTML, so marked emits it verbatim and DOMPurify keeps `pre`/`code`. The
author adds no `language-*` class - but PrismJS DOES, at highlight time: its
core normalises a missing language to `none` and stamps `language-none` on both
the `code` and its parent `pre`. Measured on this very element, settled: with
the class present the light `pre` is cream and its `code` transparent, while the
dark `pre` and `code` are BOTH `#2d2d2d`; with the class stripped, both `pre`
elements paint nothing and only the dark `code` still carries `#2d2d2d`.

So in the first case the dark `code` background is a duplicate of the `pre`
behind it and is not visible - what the golden pins there is byte-exact
fidelity, not appearance. The stripped case is where
`body.dark-mode .markdown-body code` was load-bearing: with no `language-*`
class the dark `pre` paints nothing and the `code` background is the only panel
there is. That state is reached transiently on every full render before Prism
runs, and permanently in the `typeof Prism === "undefined"` fallback path.

### Heading levels

#### Level four

The six heading levels each carry their own `::before` collapse arrow, written
as one six-part selector list. Only the levels this fixture actually renders can
be measured, so all six appear here: with h4-h6 absent, three parts of that list
had no subject in the document and section 10h's coverage check reported them
as unreached - a rule painting text that no contrast assertion could see.

##### Level five

###### Level six
